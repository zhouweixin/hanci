[{"review": "I am collecting these unique guitar picks and putting them into pick display cases.  This is a great pick!  I am using the other 5 and they play very well!", "id": 674}, {"review": "Really cool looking and are nice picks for the $$.  The eye holes really do make it a better gripping pick than a standard pick.  Great deal from amazon - - thanks!!  I will definitely buy more of these in the future!!", "id": 1149}, {"review": "a little small for my hands, but the kids that take lessons from me loved them.  Cute idea.  Would like different holiday designs like this.", "id": 395}, {"review": "These picks are pretty cool, fairly stiff despite their thinness. They are also a bit pointier than regular picks, and the eye holes give it an interesting tactile quality. Nice to try something new, although they are a bit slippery.", "id": 207}, {"review": "I rarely play with one, as I prefer a thin pick and these are more along the lines of medium, but when I do pull one out of my pocket to play, it always gets attention.", "id": 110}]
