[{"review": "These knobs arrived in perfect condition, the correct color and fit my Stratocaster remake well. You can't necessarily go wrong with knobs. I like the black look to my guitar now.", "id": 1165}, {"review": "Need 2 volume knobs and 1 tone, so for the price (and in the past) I have always purchased 2 packs together with no issues, however recently I needed and ordered some and I found out of 4 sets, no consistency in quality... example the lettering is thinner on some than others within the same set and between sets of the same item#. Also some had bright white lettering and others did not (but where not vintage lettering either). Guess these are too cheap for Fender to have QC on.Will try other brands next time.", "id": 154}, {"review": "These knobs fit well on the pots in my strat and they match the color of the black fender pickguard as well. They look nice, work well, were easy to replace, and do the job. What more could you ask of strat knobs?", "id": 1363}, {"review": "I needed good knobs! I enjoy them! I highly recommend them! They will last for a long time and they are a good product!", "id": 278}, {"review": "These are perfect, but for hybrid projects where more than three knobs are needed I would like to have more individual ones available rather than the restriction of quantity and descriptions contained in the package. I have had to borrow other knobs for other potentiometers which don't match, they are functional but aesthetically imbalanced", "id": 677}, {"review": "bought these for my Squire Strat. I was changing the look with new pickgaurd, nobs and switch tips.  these nobs fit great and look great. I would difenantly recomend them", "id": 115}, {"review": "I have an abundance of strat parts.  So when a vintage non-strat type guitar came acrossed my workbench, I plunked these on the pots.  The customer liked them so much, he kept them on.  Now what to do with these other knobs?", "id": 806}, {"review": "Well, unless you absolutely botch production, it's hard to go wrong with some guitar knobs. Typical plastic, durable, and looks good.", "id": 1029}]
