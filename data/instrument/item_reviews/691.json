[{"review": "its perfectly done but it seems its not fitting Squire fender guitar in terms of E-to-E string spacing, The Low E string out of range and not fit in the hole :(", "id": 1355}, {"review": "Great tone and tuning stability. Was a direct drop in for my epi wildkat.  Really helped with the bigsby tuning stability", "id": 359}, {"review": "good,  but it not fit properly,  Defenley better then bone thogh  I did have  to sand it to try to make it fit good, and I did Put it on my epiphone LP,  It does give a nice blues tone,  Beause it's not bone.  But I had to take it off case it just did not fit right", "id": 152}, {"review": "Perfect replacement.  Did have to take off a little on either side, but other than that it fits.  I used it on a First Act ME501.", "id": 224}, {"review": "Such an easy part to install even if you are a clutz.  Makes a massive difference to the sound and can be a half decent price sometimes.  Worth every penny mind you...  Does require some length and height adjustment for some Epiphones and you should have some basic tools and glue to make it stay put..  So far so good.", "id": 635}]
