[{"review": "I've got several guitars and CAPOs - this one is not too bad. I would still prefer classic style. Seems like spring is a bit too strong. Price is great thou!", "id": 1409}, {"review": "Easy to use from day one and I am a beginner at the guitar - would recommend it to any one.", "id": 1415}, {"review": "I bought this in order to have one in my 12 string guitar case. I like to keep a capo in each of my guitar cases. It works okay for 6 string guitars, but not even okay for 12 string guitars, plus the spring, became loose. You get what you pay for in this case.", "id": 977}, {"review": "This works fine on a standard guitar.  No issues whatever.  I see other reviewers having issues.  Not sure if that's from rough handling.  But for casual use this one is completely fine.", "id": 1024}, {"review": "Looks better than the expansive one my Grandson has.  He keeps using MINE!!!  Arrived early and is of great quality.  Fits my VERY old acoustic just right!", "id": 89}]
