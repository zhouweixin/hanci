[{"review": "Got a packet to try but I found they are better than the Gator screws that came with my case! My equipment is very secure. Highly recommended.", "id": 1255}, {"review": "They are screws. They screw in and hold things. To say that they did less would've gotten the 1 star. I like them.", "id": 622}, {"review": "Excellent rack screws with washers. Its fit very good to rack holes. Good presentation and well packed. I will buy again.", "id": 1347}, {"review": "So far the ones I have used have all threaded nicely into our 16u rack. There are exactly as described and do the job. What more can a guy say about a little box of screws? Maybe I should post some pics of the little buggers in action?", "id": 789}, {"review": "Pros:* They look very nice.* They cause much less wear than the 2nd hand rack screws and washers.Cons:* More expensive and I had to wait a few days longer than it took my rack equipment to ship.I'd purchase these again, but I now have 25 but only need 16 at the most once my rack is filled.", "id": 105}, {"review": "I replaced all the stock mounting screws that came with our sound rack cabinet with these, as they were nearly invisible with the black rails and mounting plates. The plastic washers also seem to protect the finishes better than metal washers on the equipment I mounted. Inexpensive, and worth it.", "id": 275}, {"review": "Donr be fooled by the imitations... should be their slogan.

They work.", "id": 282}, {"review": "Good quality rack screws that come with rubber washers to protect face of equipment.  Arrived ahead of estimated arrival time which is always nice.", "id": 240}, {"review": "Other than that, when you need 10-32 rack screws, these are the real McCoy.  Wide enough pan to grab the ear, narrow enough to clear that next piece of gear!  Thanks, Raxxess!", "id": 615}]
