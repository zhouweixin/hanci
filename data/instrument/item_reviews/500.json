[{"review": "These have it all. Sound great, play great, feel great, tune great. I am now dedicated to these strings. It takes about 4 or 5 days before the strings are fully stretched and holding onto its tuning. Once it does, it's beautiful music after that.", "id": 570}, {"review": "I play a Cordoba Classical, and these strings are the best I've found for it. The bass strings really resound, all strings stretch and hold within three days, and they last longer than I've expected for classical strings. I've not yet had a broken string with them.", "id": 412}, {"review": "I've bought these D'Addario strings a few times because they are a great deal. They sound nice and bright, and they last a good while. They are easy on the fingers. The best part is that you save money by buying them in a 3-pack.", "id": 394}, {"review": "Put these on my new La Patrie Motif and could not be happier.The tension is just right for soft finger style &#34;manouche jazz&#34;Sleepy D'jango", "id": 98}, {"review": "I did purchase this strings because of review of other folks who have more expiriance in that area. And look like I make very good choice.", "id": 511}, {"review": "These strings aren't anything fancy, but they sound great. A good old standard that I've used since I was a kid. And this is the best price I've found.", "id": 1213}, {"review": "These strings are as advertised.  Nice tone and good quality.  Can't remember the last time I've found a bad string from a set of these.  Actually prefer the medium tension for a 650mm scale guitar.  Got the high tension ones for a shorter scale instrument so they wouldn't be too sloppy at concert pitch.", "id": 993}, {"review": "Simple review here...Good Strings help create Good Sound!!!These are nice strings and on a quality instrument stay in tune well. They are not overly bright nor dark but rather have a nice \"round\" sound to them. Highly recommend.", "id": 287}]
