This was the cheapest.  So it goes.", "id": 522}, {"review": "I've had this for 4 days and so far it's still working perfectly. I use it for my distortion box as a lot of people are as well.

Well,....that's not the case here.  This power supply is well made (durable) and performs to the specs supplied.  I guess a person can take the risk of buying a variable output adaptor with the proper power pin configuration,...but why go to all that trouble?  This product lives up to it's calling.  Besides, who wants to keep changing batteries in the Stobe Tuner (Planet Waves) when this power adaptor is easy to plug in and forget.  I gave it a 5-star rating because the price is fair, the product is well made and works, and it was shipped well within the promised time.  By today's standards, that's as good as it gets.DP", "id": 189}, {"review": "This is what these things should cost and this is how they should work.

I have many different makes of power supplies. In the end, they are all the same. Proof of this lies in the Boss unit I have owned for 20 years.Amazon had the Planet Waves 9v supply for the lowest price, lower than local retailers and if you do not use or need a &#34;1 Spot&#34; this will not let you down.

Can't beat this one for sure :-)", "id": 1125}, {"review": "I bought this adapter to power several devices by different manufacturers. Thus far, I am very pleased.

I would definitely recommend it to a friend.", "id": 569}, {"review": "works well with every pedal i tried so far. Can't ask much more than that from it.

Ok that being said , I searched for lowest costing 9v adaptor that met or exceeded the am required to run my pedals...this came up first and is IMO all that one would need to run a pedal or other guitar add ons. I dont know what else to say..... The cord isn't very long but not overly short either, I have another brand adapter and it is about the same length and size etc. ok for now that's all I got, I may edit later on down the line.", "id": 825}, {"review": "you will want this to save your battery's when there is no power around not much more to say good luck", "id": 1231}, {"review": "Right product at the right price.

This has an output of 300 Milli-amps. For electronics the voltage has to be correct. But an appliance will only draw as many amps (current) as it needs. So this adapter is coasting when used with the guitar processor and can be used with other devices that draw up to the 300 Mamps. Just be sure your (9v) device doesn't require more than the 300 Ma this can deliver.
