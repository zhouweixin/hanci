Overall it is a great quality cable and it came quickly. What more could you ask for", "id": 435}, {"review": "As it is with most things in life, you get what you pay for and while this Hosa effects-connecting cable isn't the best quality cable that is out there e.g. Zaolla, Evidence etc it certainly does the job it's supposed to at a reasonable price.  Too few guitarists, and I was one of them for many years until recently, pay enough attention to the quality of their cables and hence spend too much time on the amps, the pick ups, strings etc.  I discovered way too late how important investing in high quality cables is to your sound but I guess better late than never.  However, if you are on a budget and you are looking for effects-connecting cables that do a job for a good price then these Hosa ones will do a good enough job.  For me, after much experimentation I have foundZaolla ZGTR-110 Guitar Cableto be the best for my sound and while they are not cheap they are certainly quality and worth the money for the improved sound they provide.These Hosa however are still good value for money and hence come recommended.", "id": 486}, {"review": "Without going over the fiscal cliff these cables worked very well in my 7-pedal guitar effect lineup.No noticeable hiss, hum or buzzing.
