It would be hard to beat.", "id": 1414}, {"review": "This is a perfect strap sized just right for mandolin.I would have given it five stars except mine arrived with a paper label glued to the back of the strap, which when peeled off left a sticky spot on the strap where it would press against the mandolin finish.", "id": 409}]
