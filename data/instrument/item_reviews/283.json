Works well with the electric violin and mic my daughter got for Christmas. Will buy more in future", "id": 1367}, {"review": "This with my Behringer XM8500 is perfect.I like that it is branded with the planet waves logo on the connectors rather than plain XLR cables Which adds a sense of a quality look my gear. This goes directly into my Focusrite 2i2 interface and I'm planning on using this same cable with a condenser microphone I have yet to purchase.", "id": 90}, {"review": "I've been using this mic cable for over ten years, and it had come up missing after an event. I looked everywhere I could think of, and thought I had lost it for good. One day, I happened to look between a ball of TV cable wire in the rehearsal room, and there it was. I didn't remember where I'd gotten it, or even the manufacturer. Although I have more than a dozen mic cables, this pliable cable, with it's own elastic clasp, was always my favorite.  I was ecstatic the day I found it, after months without it, and now have a backup. I highly recommend this cable.", "id": 57}, {"review": "So far so good!
