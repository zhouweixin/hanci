[{"review": "Unless you're going to go for the very top of the line most expensive professional chords, these will do for any medium sized venue.", "id": 6}, {"review": "These work just like you want them to.  But a new strap and put these on right away.  It's worth it.", "id": 44}, {"review": "I use these with Ernie Ball regular slinkies.  I find that if you stay right in the middle then you can play a very wide variety of styles.  It's also cheaper.", "id": 120}, {"review": "I really like the mediums.  They are able to play the biggest variety of styles without being too heavy or not durable enough.", "id": 226}, {"review": "A little nicer than I thought it would be. As far as inexpensive straps go this one is worth it.  I like the pick pocket too.  But don't let the pocket be the selling point.  It's not that cool.", "id": 285}, {"review": "Not very bright. Not very flexible. Too big. Clunky. I really don't like it. I wish I had went in a different direction.", "id": 388}, {"review": "Comes in a really nice case.  Works great.  Great price. Very light.  Can't speak to durability because haven't had them long and haven't used them heavily.", "id": 405}, {"review": "It's not an entire bridge assembly but it's exactly what I needed. In my opinion it is worth the money.", "id": 678}, {"review": "They're round and they fit over microphones.  Work well to stop pops and lisps.  Have been very happy with them.", "id": 778}, {"review": "I really like the mediums.

Only for indoor really light use.  So I can't speak to it's durability at this time. But I like it because it's cheap, light, and it works.", "id": 376}, {"review": "Unless you're going to get a very expensive professional chord this is just as good as any other and works great for medium sized venues.", "id": 419}, {"review": "I don't use it for any heavy use.
