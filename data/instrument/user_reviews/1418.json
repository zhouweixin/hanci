[{"review": "This is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound. I use it with a Fender Mustang amp and an Ibanez guitar with good humbucking pickups. It's very easy to use and rugged. If you play metal, you might want to get the HardWire TL-2 instead; that pedal delivers more distortion (an insane amount, if necessary) and more tone control, but it's also more expensive. But you can easily boost the distortion achieved by the DS-1 by using it with your amp on an overdriven setting. The DS-1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal. I don't know of any other that achieves this level of quality in the same price-range.", "id": 35}, {"review": "I have several overdrive pedals, some of which are much more expensive than the BOSS SD-1. For a long time I overlooked my SD-1 and used other pedals. But when I went back to trying the SD-1, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this relatively inexpensive pedal is superior to some of the pedals I had been using. I don't mean merely that it's \"very good relative to its price\"; I mean that it's \"very good--period.\" It easily outclasses some pedals for which I paid much more. The price for this pedal sometimes goes down to about $45 on Amazon. At that price, it's an amazingly good deal. Note: This is definitely an overdive pedal; it will not deliver metal distortion (at least not by itself). If you want to ride the crazy train, look elsewhere (like Deltalab's Metal Distortion pedal). What this produces is smooth old-style overdrive. It's excellent. It sounds especially good through a dash of chorus. I plug my SD-1 into a Fender Mustang II amp and turn on the amp's chorus; the result is delicious. I've used the SD-1 with both single-coil and double-coil pickups. Both sound good, though, not surprisingly, you get a heavier punch with a humbucker. But it sounds great with single-coils too.", "id": 38}, {"review": "This is a superb tremolo pedal: [1] Its dials allow for enormous control of the effect. [2] It's very sturdy--an often-noted feature of BOSS pedals. Further, [3] it's utterly easy to use, [4] allows for both 9v battery and power supply/adapter operation, and, most important of all, [5] it delivers beautiful tremolo. (Note: It comes with a 9v battery installed, but it does NOT come with a power source/adapter.) If the price is more than you're willing to pay, consider the DANELECTRO COOL CAT TREMOLO. This also delivers good tremolo, but it does not allow for as much sound-manipulation as the BOSS product; it's still quite good, but the BOSS takes the prize. I paid about $75 for mine and have zero regrets.", "id": 39}, {"review": "I have several MXR pedals. Every one is superb--except for this PHASE 90 (the non-\"script\" version reviewed here). This PHASE 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean, for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion, a swoosh of sonic dirt. I did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal's distortion suggest some modifications. (Look up \"MXR Phase 90 Mods,\" and \"Erik's Corner\" will show you how.) I made the \"R28,\" \"C11,\" and \"C12\" modifications. The result: a slightly improved phaser, one that still churned out plenty of distortion. Finally, I tried adjusting the internal trim pot. On no setting could I get rid of ... you guessed it: distortion. I spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable. No luck. BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU WANT A PHASER THAT DOESN'T ADD SIGNIFICANT DISTORTION, AVOID THIS INCARNATION OF THE PHASE 90.", "id": 177}, {"review": "I cannot shower enough praise on the LPB-1. It currently sells for about $40 and improves your sound when combined with any other pedal (especially overdrive/distortion pedals) or on its own. I keep it on all the time, since it always improves sound-quality.", "id": 365}, {"review": "Within just three seconds of using the Electro-Harmonix Pocket Metal Muff Pedal, I knew it was a winner. It delivers thermonuclear distortion and is ultra-easy to use. Although it doesn't have a tone dial, it doesn't need one. And I say that after trying it through a small tube amp (15w), a small digital amp (40w), a guitar with humbuckers, and a guitar with single-coil pickups. The closest it has to a tone dial is the scoop switch just above the on/off switch. As its name suggests, this allows one to choose how much the mid tones will be \"scooped.\" It has three settings (no scoop to maximal scoop), and all sound great. Fans of sustain will love this box, for it delivers seemingly everlasting sustain. The pedal is extremely small, which most would regard as a plus. I bought this after watching a professional-looking YouTube demonstration of it. It more than lived up to my expectations. If I lost this box, I'd immediately order another one. I have zero regrets.", "id": 397}, {"review": "The CM-2 is magnificent: [1] It produces beautiful overdrive (one that doesn't destroy your guitar's tone). [2] It has independent \"High\" and \"Low\" tone controls, and these controls are extremely sensitive to even minor changes--thus allowing for great versatility in tone-manipulation. [3] It features a switch that allows you to pick between \"classic\" overdrive and an extra blast of distortion (\"modified\"). [4] The case is made of metal. [5] It comes with a cover for the knobs so that you can avoid altering your settings when depressing the pedal. This pedal will not give you \"metal\" distortion; for that consider Digitech's TL-2. Instead, it produces a warm, old-time overdriven tone. I love this thing!", "id": 529}, {"review": "GOOD POINTS: [1] This cable, unlike many other coiled cables I've tried, does NOT add noise when it's moved. I swung it about quite a bit while playing through it, and it made no noise at all. [2] It also has good plugs in that the indentation on the male plug provides a generous gap, making it easy for the female jack to connect to the male end. As a result, the cable does not slip out TOO easily; the connection between jack and plug is quite secure. BAD POINTS: [1] The package it comes in says it's a 20-foot cable. Not even close! Holding it up by one end, with the other end simply dangling (i.e., not plugged into anything), I saw that it measures 3 feet (again, that's when it's not stretched); when not stretched at all, it measures just 3 feet. Of course, this would not result in 20 feet when it's stretched. Sure enough, when I plugged it into an amp, I could COMFORTABLY stretch it to only about 6.5 feet. This might not bother you; it doesn't bother me since I didn't want the extra cable length. But if you need anything like a 20-foot cable, you're going to have to get something else. [2] Finally, a minor point: If you're using this on a guitar with a Strat-style jack, this cable will be a bit---but only a bit---more difficult than most cables to unplug from the guitar, no matter which end you plug into your guitar, because there's not much to grip when unplugging. Of course, if you pull on the cable itself, instead of one of the ends, you'll ruin it in no time. Overall, I am quite happy with this cable and would buy more, since I don't need more than the length it has, and since it makes no noise.", "id": 709}, {"review": "The BAD MONKEY overdrive pedal does not produce \"Crazy Train\" metal distortion. It isn't made to, and thus if you buy it for that sound you're off target. (If that's the sound you want, I recommend: DigiTech TL-2 HardWire Metal Distortion Extreme-Performance Pedal.) What the BAD MONKEY produces is delicious, bluesy overdrive at a highly competitive price (it currently sells for $49.95 here at Amazon). Unlike so many overdrive/distortion pedals, the BAD MONKEY has independent (and sensitive) dials for treble (\"high\") and bass (\"low\"), and using them can greatly affect the resulting sound; they are by no means token dials. In particular, the bass dial can be used to increase bass to an amazing degree (especially when using double-coil pickups); it's easy to achieve a \"fat\" sound with this pedal. The pedal does not come with, but does accept, an external power supply (i.e., an adapter). It can also be powered with a 9V battery, which is installed under what's literally the pedal portion (just as in BOSS pedals). The BAD MONKEY is made of metal and can be used as a weapon if so needed. It seems extremely rugged, again like BOSS pedals. I have several overdrive/distortion pedals, but I find myself turning to this one again and again. My impression of the BAD MONKEY is based on using it with [i] an Ibanez guitar with good double-coil pickups, [ii] an Ibanez guitar with good single-coil pickups (similar to \"soapbar\" style, or P-90, pickups), and [iii] a Fender Mustang II amp. It works well with both single- and double-coil pickups. If I lost my pedal, I would order another right away. I've been playing for over 30 years and can say with confidence that this is a great pedal.", "id": 145}, {"review": "The Little Big Muff does one thing spectacularly well: it delivers massive fuzz-plus-sustain. For that purpose, it's excellent, both in sound and construction (it feels like a metal brick). However, be warned: if you're looking for a standard \"distortion pedal,\" this is not it. It's a fuzz pedal. It delivers ferocious fuzz but is not a general purpose distortion pedal (like, say, a BOSS DS-1). If a great fuzz pedal is what you want, this is a superb choice--and, so far as I know, the best one for its price. If the price is still too much for you, consider the ModTone Fuzzer, which is about as good but substantially cheaper (at least as I write this).", "id": 448}]
