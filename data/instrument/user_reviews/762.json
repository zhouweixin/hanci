[{"review": "This is simply the best power supply out there!  Everything is so quiet, with no hum.....powered perfectly.  Although I don't use all the options (such as the SAG option, and different voltage options, etc), it's great to have them available to me.  I'd LOVE two more ports........but I guess you can't have it all!", "id": 209}, {"review": "Needed patch cables for my pedal board.  They did what I expected them to do.  Not to bulky, and the right angle plugs save space.", "id": 578}, {"review": "Wow, I'm really impressed with this tuner.  Strumming the strings gives you a quick overview of which strings are out of tune and as you tune each string it automatically switches to a chromatic mode.  It's quick, it's accurate, and it just works......WELL!!!", "id": 650}, {"review": "These are the ONLY straplocks I use, and I have them for ALL of my guitars.  They are the only ones I trust.  They are solid, secure, and they look great.  And the push button release makes them pretty convenient too, without sacrificing security.  Love 'em!!", "id": 44}, {"review": "I've already posted about Fast Fret.  I love this stuff.  It's a mandatory inclusion in every one of my guitar cases.", "id": 72}, {"review": "I returned the SKB PS-45 and got the PT-2 as a replacement.  The SKB is a well built board, but the Pedaltrain boards are simply the best functional design available, period!!  And designing them with the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power in mind is stroke of genius.  Providing the brackets to mount......another brilliant stroke.  This is a no-brainer.  This is your best option for a top flight pedalboard.  Great job!", "id": 544}]
