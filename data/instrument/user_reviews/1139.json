[{"review": "The only instrument this works well on is my Yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings, for steel strings I want more pressure, I advise getting the NS Capo that is not \"lite\",  I prefer that one above this model.", "id": 304}, {"review": "This is a great value for a practice and travel instrument.(I got mine with free shipping)Built like an instrument, not a toy, it is an interesting crossover between a high strung guitar and ukelele. Fun to play, easy to take along, stays in tune well enough, and it's only a hundred bucks. I bet if you bought one you would like it.", "id": 747}, {"review": "This is my third Snark tuner, I keep giving them away to people who think they can tune by ear. I use it on all my stringed instruments, (Haven't tried it on a base) This tuner is easy to attach and read, and the price is great, I have spent 60 bucks on tuners that do not function as well.", "id": 763}, {"review": "The Snark SN-8(B)Super Tight All Instrument Tuner is the best Snark tuner I've purchased, of 4 models. This SN-8, has a matte type finish, not glossy, it has a gun metal black look to me which I prefer to the glossy finished models. The dial, is easy to read, the bars on the dial are bold. All Snark Tuners are a great value, they function as well as any brand.", "id": 811}, {"review": "I like the adjustable tension of this capo, I don't think its as easy to put on a \"Kyser\" capo of this style, but once on the neck, the Planet Waves NS Tri-Action Capo moves easily, and has even pressure across the fingerboard, a result of the adjustable tension I surmise. Some day I will use the pick holder, not right away, some night when I'm feeling I need my pick held.", "id": 843}]
