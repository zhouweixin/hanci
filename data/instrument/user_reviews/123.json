[{"review": "Standard 10-46 nickel wound set- great for most general purpose playing- like rock, blues, country, what ever. Some more advanced players might prefer boutique strings like DR, but these are good for most folks!", "id": 226}, {"review": "Volume control is nice. Two clicks to choose from- the low click is better than the high one to my ear. I would recommend this product.", "id": 390}, {"review": "JJ's are great tubes! This 12AT7 replaced a 12AX7 in the preamp of an Epi Valve Jr to soften the gain and sweeten the tone- it was very nice, but I found an old American made 12AU7 that I like more- the JJ is still a great tube.", "id": 459}, {"review": "I've got a bunch of these little tuners- I keep one with each instrument. They are a little tough on batteries, but they are accurate, even picking up notes below E on my double bass C extension.Highly recommend!", "id": 706}, {"review": "This pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like CRAZY! You will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unit.I'm not too fond of the sound quality of the reverb either- there are a LOT of better sounding units out there but some folks might find it acceptable.Over all I would not recommend this product.", "id": 185}, {"review": "This is a very accurate tuner. I have used it on mandolins, guitars, violins and violas, and double bass. They are a little hard on batteries, but not overly so.Highly recommend!", "id": 762}]
