[{"review": "I have an electronic indoor/outdoor thermometer that shows relative humidity and a whole house humidifier.It is interesting to see just how quickly relative humidity changes inside and outside with that electronic thermometer.The whole house humidifier pumps out about 3 gallons of water a day into a 1500 sq ft house during the fall and winter keeping the indoor humidity around 47%.This makes the house feel warmer and makes my breathing easier. Makes the whole house safer for the Martins.Now you can use a little in the case humidifier like this to help with humidity, but I think you really need a whole house solution and a monitor system.A sponge in a zip lock bag with a few holes works well too. Just don't get water on the wood.And don't forget to take the silica gel packs out of the little accessory compartment in the case. Many guitars come shipped with these and their job is to remove humidity from the case.All the better acoustic guitar shops I go to have a big humidifier running in their showrooms.", "id": 71}, {"review": "Sturdily holds three guitars. Fits everything from my bass, to the acoustic or electrics, to the mandolin/ukulele, to the harmonicas in the case.Folds up for transport. Pretty adjustable too.I bought this after buying two of the single guitar stands from Hercules. I also have the trombone and sax/clarinet stand from them. All A+ at reasonable prices.", "id": 301}, {"review": "I love this little device!I'm an amateur musician so I'm on and off on playing. I play enough I need to know theory, but not so often I don't forget the specifics.This gizmo lets me refresh all of those pesky details with the slide of a tab.I don't believe this is a tool to teach people music theory, but it is a wonderful reference once you know what you're looking for.For example, I'm playing with the harmonica now. Simple little instrument right? Well that simple little instrument has you thinking about major, minor, major pentatonic, minor pentatonic, and blues scales in 12 different keys! One section of this wheel lists all of these different scales. Rotate the dial to the key you're interested in and the individual notes for each of these scales in the key you've selected appears. Nice.Although I play guitar, I find the other side of the wheel less helpful. Yes it does show you how to play diatonic chords (MmmMMmD)but they are barre chords based upon the \"E\" chord. If you understand the formation of an E barre chord and its family (E, Em, E7, Esus, Esus4, etc), this may not be so helpful. I really don't use E barre chords much beyond the 7 fret as I usually switch to the \"A\" type barre chord based off of the 5th string so my hand has much less distance to travel. I've not found anything to support these \"A\" type barre chords nor the others: D, G, C.I find the music theory side of the wheel worth the price and the disillusionment with the guitar side my be due to my ignorance.", "id": 531}, {"review": "It does what a guitar tuner should do.It simply clips onto the headstock of the guitar and easily shows you where your string is in reference to standard tuning.I do have an equally good tuner by monoprice that's about half price. Better deal if you don't just buy one and have to pay single shipping.", "id": 707}, {"review": "How far wrong can you go for $1.83? I can give these away to beginners that don't have a capo.If you really want a capo get a Keyser or other decent capo. They're only $20.", "id": 802}, {"review": "Easy to play. Decent quality. Not expensive. Easy to bend. Plastic comb with no recess.This is the lowest level you'd want to really play the harmonica and it won't break the bank.", "id": 828}]
