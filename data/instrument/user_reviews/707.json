[{"review": "I have had them on my Loar Guitar for a few weeks and they seem to work fine.  We will see how long they last.  I have used Elixir for electric and while they do last longer I wish it was a bit longer.", "id": 103}, {"review": "These do not last as long as they say they do but they do last longer than most strings.  I like them.", "id": 105}, {"review": "These hangers work great but make sure you purchase some spare screws.  The screws provided easily break when screwing into a stud so I would recommend you buy some good screws before you install.  I have several of these and at least three screws broke as I screwed them into the stud in the wall.", "id": 166}, {"review": "Good strings for the price, nice ring to them.  So far they seem to last and were a bit louder than my last strings although they were flat round and did expect them to be very loud.", "id": 198}, {"review": "What can you say about Rosin?  This rosin seems to be better than the cheapo kind I had and so I feel it is worth the extra money.", "id": 636}, {"review": "I used these on all my instruments, guitar, mandolin, and violin.  It works fine and I would recommend them at this good price.", "id": 706}, {"review": "I highly recommend these tuners.  They are the best I have found for Fiddle and Mandolin.  They also work well with acoustical guitar.", "id": 707}, {"review": "I don't know why others rated it as a 4 star.  It is exactly what it says it is and works fine.", "id": 788}, {"review": "Even though it is Fender it was made in China I would have thought the US.  What can you say about a guitar chord?", "id": 803}, {"review": "I have several of these for my guitar, fiddle, and mandolin.  It works well for all of them and is inexpensive.", "id": 762}, {"review": "These on my guitar as a replacement to some old ones and they work well.  I have had no problems with them.", "id": 790}]
