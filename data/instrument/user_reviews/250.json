[{"review": "To start with, I didn't buy this guitar because it was cheap, but because of the unbelievable reviews.  I don't know if they all come out of the box like this one but in the past I have owned and sold my Gretch 12, my Yamaha 12, my ovation 12, but I won't be selling this one.  I've had it for 3 months now and haven't adjusted anything, only played this $169 12 string from American Musical Supply / amazon.  It is the best playing best sounding 12 string I have ever played period...  This guitar set off a couple of other Epiphone purchases (2, one for my son) AJ220SCE's and ES-339, Also great guitars.  Most of my life Epiphones were dull over coated junk, not anymore, and it seems that Epiphone is selling cheap to get people to try them. I own Gibson Studio Les Paul, SG, '87 American Strat, Martin D35, Washburn Rogue, all nice guitars most for a LOT more money. This guitar is a NOBRAINER cannot believe the value.  American Musical Supply is also great, the first AJ220SCE came in with a bad neck and AMS emailed a return FedEx lable in an hour and after I dropped it off and it was logged in at a UPS outlet around the corner I got an email that the replacement guitar was on the way. When it arrived 3 days later it was a good one! :))  5+ star service.", "id": 153}, {"review": "I've been playing mostly acoustics over 30 years, I own a D35 Martin, Epiphone DR-212, Zager ZAD50, American Fender Strat, Gibson Studio Les Paul and have owned many others.  When my Little Red Traveler showed up at my door I was excited, but my expectation bar wasn't set too high.  I unpacked the Traveler and gave it the once over,, WOW, nicely made. Neck was perfect, just the slightest bow, frets were finished better than my Gibson when I bought it.  I found some wet/dry sand paper, I think 200 grit and spent about 10-15 minutes sanding down the bottom of the bridge bone. WOW #2 the action is much above average acoustic guitar quality, no buzz, perfect pitch at the octave and is a joy to play.  The tone is unique, not quiet, and unless you are expecting Martin sound, definitely not offensive.  The sound is kind of acoustic guitar/ukulele, banjo ish.  I'm thinking with a nice pickup it would make quite nice/unique a acoustic lead instrument. Plays great to the top fret.  love it!  Unbelievable instrument, a pleasure play.  Oh and the case is a $40+ freebee ;))) Buy one, be happy.  One last thing, another post mentioned putting your right arm outside the strap and tying between the tuning keys, that works well.", "id": 252}, {"review": "I use this on the fretboard of my new Hohner wc03 Parlor and two Epiphone AJ220sce Acoustics. They had mimimal oil/stain from the factory.  Keeps the wood smooth and beautiful for much longer than a few weeks.  I use it every other time I restring my guitars, It is a really good product, I use it on all of my guitars, except my Strat that has a maple neck..", "id": 344}, {"review": "Look no further these are great bags.. Well padded, lots of good pockets, does all that it should. Very pleased..", "id": 469}, {"review": "Have used them for years, bought some new guitars, had to have.  Wish they had something for Acoustic Electric 1/4&#34; backplug", "id": 790}, {"review": "it is a hardshell case, about what I expected, decent low end hardshell but serviceable. I wouldn't check in with an airline, I can lean on the top and push it in. for a little extra protection over a gig bag YES, don't put an amp on top of it in a van though.", "id": 859}, {"review": "Works great, does what it should, holds all my guitars securely.  acoustic and electric, but not at the same time.  haha", "id": 883}, {"review": "Adds a little sustain and they look sharp, but not gaudy, put them on my Martin D-35, Epiphone AJ 220SCE and Washburn Travel Series RO10TR ,,,, nice.", "id": 206}]
