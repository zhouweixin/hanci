[{"review": "Nothing fancy about this strap, unless you want to count the pick pocket at one end. Just well made and functional.I got this for my grandson's Squier (by Fender) 3/4 size acoustic. It doesn't have a strap button at the top end. It would have been nice if this had come with a lace of some type to tie on just above the nut. But I work with leather and I found a nice piece of rawhide lace to serve this purpose. Not everyone would necessarily have the materials at hand.", "id": 285}, {"review": "I was first exposed to the Hercules locking mechanism when our Praise Band leader brought in his Hercules two-guitar stand and I tried it with both my full-size 12-string guitar and my 5-string banjo. I was impressed. When I decided to buy some guitar hangers to reorganize my music room/amateur studio, I was excited to find that the same Hercules mechanism was available in a couple wall-hanger models. I put them on my wish list, where my son & daughter-in-law found them and bought three for me for Christmas this last weekend. I just finished putting them up and I'm completely satisfied with their solid construction. They give me confidence that they will hold my instruments reliably. I used the provided screws, which worked great for mounting them on the plank walls. I probably wouldn't trust the hollow wall anchors provided for drywall, but instead get something more substantial to mount it (like a toggle anchor).What I'm happiest about is that these hangers can be used with a variety of stringed instruments. The opening is wide enough to accommodate my classical guitar and 12-string guitars but not so wide as to not support my 5-string banjo. (I've submitted a photo showing them holding up a classical & 12-string guitars, and 5-string banjo). My friend plays Gretch semi-hollow body and Fender solid-body (and other) electric guitars with his Hercules 2-guitar stand, so I assume they would also work with the wall hangers.I am happy to recommend this handy little device to anyone who wants to get their favorite instrument up out of the way but still keep it handy.", "id": 289}, {"review": "This strap is really beautiful. The Native American pattern goes beautifully with the classical guitar I made with the images of wolves burned into the top. However, the leather ends are very thick and stiff, making it very hard to slip over the strap buttons on the guitar. I tried to put the snap-on strap buttons but had to really work the holes on the strap with an Exacto knife to get the strap to slip over them. I have a nice Ralph Marlin strap with soft, pliable leather on the ends and the slip on and off the strap buttons with little effort - workable with one hand. I'd give this Levy's strap 5 stars if its ends were as flexible.", "id": 482}, {"review": "When I made a larger pedal board (from plywood) to accommodate a new pedal tuner, I could not pull the power-grip tape from the old board to reuse it! The adhesive is extremely strong, and the unique locking surface is almost as strong. Works great.", "id": 765}, {"review": "When I originally went out to place this order, I was planning to order the  TC Electronics Singles VoiceTone C1 Vocal Effects Processor for its pitch correction function. As I looked over that device and some alternatives, I finally ordered the TC-Helicon Mic Mechanic because it had pitch correction and some other very nice effects. I ignored the reviewers who said the pitch correction function had no effect - how could TC Electronics put out the &#34;Mic Mechanic&#34; with a pitch correction function that didn't do anything? Well, those reviewers were right - the pitch correction function has NO EFFECT! Also, I couldn't see any effect between engaging/disengaging the tone button. I kept the Mic Mechanic because I like the other effects, but I'm very disappointed in the primary reason I bought it!", "id": 849}]
