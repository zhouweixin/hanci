[{"review": "This was a great investment for my home studio. I've been able to eliminate the majority of pops coming from my Condenser Microphone. I should of bought this a long time ago!!", "id": 46}, {"review": "I'm sure glad that I bought these straps, there not leather but are put together very well. I plan on using them as backups in the studio. The price was just right, cam quickly and I'd buy them again.", "id": 74}, {"review": "I was looking for a financially good deal. The price was so reasonable, I said, \"How can something this cheap be that good\",..well they were a great investment. I use them all the time and have had people ask me where I purchased such a great sounding cadiod microphone. When I told them the price, they thought I was pulling there leg,..I wasn't. The case is plastic, foam and clips. Three good clips would cost you ten dollars alone, now compare for yourself. I'd buy these again in a heart beat. I just might buy another 3-pack!!", "id": 405}, {"review": "It's always been a problem trying to keep the Desk microphone in one place. Promblem resolved, by purchasing this stand my heavy Shure57 stays in one place. The only thing is I wish the flex was a little longer, about three inches would be great. But otherwise a wise and good purchase.", "id": 633}, {"review": "I've been using these picks for eight months and they last forever. I lose them before they wear out. I'll be buying and recommending these for a long time.", "id": 567}]
