[{"review": "I have an electro acoustic Martin (second hand but without a scratch). I got it with .13 strings and well, is simply too much. Is good to play rithyms but can't do pretty much nothing else.I have installed a set (I got 8) and it sounds really good. Not as solid as the .13 but now i have more range to do solos and go up and down much easier.Recomended", "id": 27}, {"review": "I like the picks a lot! They are super strong and look like can take a lot of use in a good shape! Recommended", "id": 61}, {"review": "You need nothing else to replace your string, no matter if you have an acoustic or a electric guitar, or both. I have a couple of acoustics and electrics and you can remove the retainers of the acoustic guitars without doing damage. is fast to tight up the string and it has a cutter if you (like me) don't like the extra hanging from the guitar like cat mustache.Recomended!", "id": 94}, {"review": "This is a fine product. Any guitar player has hands strong enough  to use it. Looks great on the guitar and works really well. Recomended.", "id": 116}, {"review": "Perfect, perfect size, weight, shape. I like the medium playing electric because it gives you the best of both worlds.Recommended!", "id": 120}, {"review": "I have mi picks available and all in the same place with this pickholder. You can stick it to the guitar. Is light and cheap.Go for it.", "id": 167}, {"review": "I really like this stand, I even bought a second one after giving it a try. Is solid, you maybe need to tight too strong to avoind the weight of the mic to bring the arm down, buy, I can do that.Recommended.", "id": 279}, {"review": "I got mine and I gave it a try, here are the conclusions:1. It looks really good, sturdy and well made.2. Is super stable, I tried it out with: 2 Strats and a electro acoustic, then removed one  Strat and placed another acoustic (a 12 string this time). I pushed the stand and.... It holds. As guitar are hanging and they are secured on the top i believe is really difficult for a guitar/bass or whatever you put in there falls down.3. You can set the height, always considering that your guitars don't reach the floor.So....... Totally recommended!", "id": 516}, {"review": "I got this amp recently, at a local store, and so far im loving it, i also aqcuired the MKII Foot Controller and is a perfect combination. Tons of sounds and it can be 100% edited to fit your demands. Nice volume coming out of it also, for 75 watts it seems more.Recommended", "id": 620}, {"review": "I bought this to use with a Spider IV 75 Amp, so far it works perfect. Provides effect control, loop control, tuner control, also has volume/wah pedal that works great. You can plug it into the PC and customize everything.Recommended!", "id": 621}, {"review": "Is kind of good, i mean it does clean the strings and oils them a little bit, tending to sound better for more time and last longer.You just get sort of bored of forget to do it every time so I'm not sure if it was worth the purchase. But is a good product.Recommended", "id": 730}]
