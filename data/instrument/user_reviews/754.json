I could use a brighter light. I forgot how dim LED lights are. I am looking to change if I can find something else.", "id": 388}, {"review": "In the beginning I had problems.  However I have a Classical Guitar and I may have been hitting dual strings accidently at first.  After several days, I felt much better about it.  I'm pretty new to this so I take the blame.", "id": 624}, {"review": "I am absolutely delighted with this tunner.  One comment, my son has one also, the neck of his broke so he warned me.  I am always very careful when turning the &#34;head&#34;.  I can see where you might break the neck if you are unaware that it could happen.  As far as tuning goes I am very pleased.  I moved from a guitar to a harp so I am tuning many more strings and this is very helpful! Plus: my vision is not the best and this one I can really see!", "id": 706}, {"review": "I have reviewed this before.  I like it, works really well.  I have a Lever Harp with 26 strings so I really needed something that would help me keep it well tuned.  One  hint from our son who also has one,  be careful when you &#34;twist&#34; the head, he broke the first one and had to buy another one.  I am very careful How I adjust and have had no problems.", "id": 811}]
