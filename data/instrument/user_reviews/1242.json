[{"review": "Bought this for my Kona K2 acoustic, it fits and holds well on the guitar with the leather ends. Its adjustable with a pick pocket, Simple, good quality, would by another.", "id": 285}, {"review": "I use this as a microphone preamp with an AKG Perception 220 microphone. There are 2 ins and 2 outs, 1 balanced/1 unbalanced on each channel. I am not an expert on studio equipment so this review is from a personal position. I run this direct to my digital recorder. I get a good clean sound on my vocals. Still to early to give reliabilty and flexability of this unit. The unit is 2 channels, has rack mounts and is sturdy, not sure on the tube yet. New to the Behringer product line, but so far I like it and will explore its potential. 5 stars for price, quality, features, amazon.", "id": 326}, {"review": "I think picks are like, well you know, a personal choice, I bought these cause they are simple, inexpensive and will compare to others I have. Been using these lately. Would buy again.", "id": 574}, {"review": "What a difference a pop filter makes, I use on a condenser mic, it lets me get a little more gain input, clamps on easy and holds good, the flex piece holding the filter could be a little more rigid but does the job. I like the way it looks when mounted on the mic stand extension, It has improved the vocal tracks. Just one more affordable improvement for the home studio.", "id": 46}, {"review": "I recently bought these for my home studio, so far so good, keyboards to mixer. They are a little flimsy, but so far no problems, have extras if necessary, high end cables also break down. They were packaged very good and the cable wraps are a plus. For the price and selection and results, works for me.", "id": 440}]
