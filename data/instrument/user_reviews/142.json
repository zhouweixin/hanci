[{"review": "These things are heavy duty and thick.  The stock ones they replaced are so wimpy next to these things.  Quality devices.", "id": 270}, {"review": "I see sales people at guitar stores walking around with these things clipped to their shirts.  Much more fun than a black box. I own one of each model.", "id": 706}, {"review": "The traditional black box tuners are boring and slow.  This thing is super responsive to string selection just hopping on the new tone immediately, exact, easy to use, fun to look at.  There is a linkage arm that is not shown in the photo that makes it even better.", "id": 707}, {"review": "One thing tho.  When your guitar isn't in it is prone to being hit and launching picks everywhere.  I am going to be finding picks in my files for years.  Put it up on the table when your picks are not in it.", "id": 746}, {"review": "Basically because they are the easiest to squeeze in my opinion.  I have big hands which may be part of it.", "id": 25}, {"review": "Depending on where you hold it the stiffness changes.  That comes in handy.  They make another version which is less pointy...I like that one a little bit better.", "id": 170}, {"review": "Picks with no texture or friction enhancement are old technology.  These pick are cutting edge.  None better.  Possibility created by the multi-flex feature and the grip.  Awesome.  These make me a better player.  I used to have trouble holding on to picks.  Problem solved.  Stress gone.", "id": 503}, {"review": "I already had the other two Snarks and then I borrowed this version in a shop from another patron.  The readout is cool.  Makes me feel good inside to look at it.", "id": 820}]
