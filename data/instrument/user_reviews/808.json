[{"review": "I am a beginner guitarist, I am happy with this capo. It works good and that is all I need. The fit and finish seems like quality also.", "id": 116}, {"review": "This is a very nice guitar, the finish and construction is high quality. The hardware is what you would expect from a Yamaha product. I really can't think of anything negative to say about it. It did not come with a strap button, sO I had to install my own, but that is true with just about every acoustic guitar.", "id": 360}, {"review": "This is a quality stand. I use it for my Yamaha acoustic guitar and it works great. Nothing but praise for this item.", "id": 601}, {"review": "Item came with two sets of screws, a long set and a shorter set. Looks good on my Yamaha acoustic guitar. Holds my strap well. I am happy I bought this.", "id": 786}, {"review": "This is a really nice music stand. I wasn't expecting it to be such high quality. I wanted something better than those cheap metal music stands that would get knocked over by a small breeze of wind. Definitely got what I wanted. The orange Gearlux logo looks pretty cool too. Buy it.", "id": 858}]
