[{"review": "I really like these things.  I don't stick tape and stuff to guitar body which if they do make a double sided tape similar to post it notes might be a good idea.  Bought a few while back and just bought a few more.  If you drop a pick there is another right there.  Have fun.", "id": 29}, {"review": "I get everything on Amazon now.  Need some strings and was ordering other stuff so bought to piggy back on shipping.  Elixir is what Tom Anderson uses and I trust his judgment.  He makes one of the finest guitars in the world if not the finest depending on what you like of course. Have a lot of them and used all kinds of other strings, I do Not like changing strings so these seem to last a decent amount of time.  Stretch them bend them and they don't break.  If your bending a couple steps or more then I would love to know what string holds up consistently.  Thanks much.", "id": 106}, {"review": "It only holds 5 heavy picks but to be fair there has to be a spring in there so its ok.  The tapered design might be to make picks eject easier?  I never owned one of these so have nothing to compare to.  Except.  I did get those wedgie pick holders and those are definitely the way to go for picks on guitars.  These are good don't get me wrong.", "id": 167}, {"review": "I always buy the gross pick package and this is a damn good deal.  Never had such colorful ones though :)  If you need picks do the math.  It pays. ships fast as always.", "id": 332}, {"review": "If your going to use on amp get some two sided Velcro and stick on amp, or two sided tape etc.  For price its fine.  Amazon is the best.", "id": 746}]
