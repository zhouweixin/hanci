[{"review": "This product works well, but I still end up doing it the old fashion way.  Guess I am not a gimmick person.  :-)", "id": 94}, {"review": "I have been trying to find the perfect gauge and this is it.  Tried 40-100 (too light and high) and 50-110 (too deep, not good for popping), but is right in the middle.  Perfect.", "id": 197}, {"review": "This is the 5th bass pick that I have tried, and finally this works great.  It does not slide out your hand and has a soft tip with a nice sound.", "id": 243}, {"review": "I use this for a bass, and while I cannot get deep tones, it is great to take to the beachor play with my acoustic guitar friends.  Tip:  it sounds better if you don't cramp it all the way up - stop at 90%.", "id": 303}, {"review": "This bench is great for the keyboards and when I just want to sit and play by bass guitar.  Regarding it being too short, you just need to lower you keyboard from a standing height, to sitting. If it is too short, then you must pay attention to the adjustable heights listed in the product description.  I also had no problem with a 'bait n switch' issue.", "id": 362}, {"review": "This is good for the money.  It is short, but works with the small amp that I purchased.  I am done", "id": 419}, {"review": "This stand was purchased to replace my older bass guitar stand - which was weak and falling apart.  I neededa more heavy duty stand and this one is perfect.", "id": 436}, {"review": "I tune by ear and the old fashion way, but this is so much better and locks in the note so you can really tell what you are doing.  Great tuner.", "id": 707}, {"review": "This bass strap is really comfortable and for a great price. BTW, that's all I have to say, so don't MAKE me type more.", "id": 188}]
