[{"review": "This pick will give you a distinct tone because it's made of metal, not plastic. I'm sure it won't wear out any time soon either. The size is regular.  I just wish it had a sharper point, but I can still pick fast enough with it to play speed metal.", "id": 171}, {"review": "These picks are kind of thin, flexible, and have a good rubber grip.  They're as good for speed-picking as they are for strumming.  The only complaint I have is that they're too thin for me.  The pack brings 6 picks.  If you're looking for thin, flexible picks with a good grip, then these will do.", "id": 503}, {"review": "These picks have a good grip.  They're pointy, so they're good for fast picking.  They're very small, about the size of a nickle, so you've been warned.  As with other Dava picks, they wear out pretty quickly.  That's the price you pay for a flexible pick I guess.", "id": 580}, {"review": "This mic works great for recording vocals on my Mac using Garage Band.  I also wanted to use it on my Xbox 360 to play Guitar Hero and Rock Band, but it's not recognized by either game as a mic.  That was surprising since it's a USB mic.  It is a tiny mic; it'll fit completely on your palm, but it can record very loud noises very clearly. It is also very sensitive when set to room recording. Excellent product.", "id": 583}, {"review": "Well built and solid stand.  It keeps the guitar well protected and looks nice too.  Some stands hold the guitar with only a hallowed little tube on the bottom, which breaks easily from the weight of the guitar.  This stand holds the guitar with two solid metal bars, which should last a long time.  It can hold both acoustic and electric guitars.  Highly recommend it.", "id": 132}]
