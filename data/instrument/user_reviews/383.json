[{"review": "These strings have great tone and feel.  They seem to maintain the tone and quality for a long period of time.", "id": 105}, {"review": "I have a number of guitars and keep them all on stand in my music room.  This stand is sturdy and protects the guitar well.", "id": 258}, {"review": "This delay pedal doesnt give you massive distortion, but a nice bit of fuzz.  I'm impressed with what you get for the price!", "id": 280}, {"review": "The One spot works very nicely for a pedal board chain.  Everything needed came with the combo, making it ready to go right out of the box.", "id": 428}, {"review": "The delay pedal was inexpensive and it works.  I dont find a lot of variance in the adjustments, but it does the job it was made for.  The case may be plastic but it appears quite rugged.", "id": 716}, {"review": "It seems to do nothing as an effect and draws power reducing the volume on your instrument as well as the amp.  Not sure if it is just a broken pedal or if it is just junk. When received the package did not appear to be damaged, but I have tried it on 3 different amps and i get the same results regardless of the amp or the instrument.", "id": 834}]
