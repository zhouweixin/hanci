[{"review": "These strings are very bright and full.  They sound great for a couple of weeks and then get a bit dead.  I haven't had any problems with breakage, just a loss of tone over time (seems faster than some other strings I've tried).", "id": 58}, {"review": "Excellent guitar strings - they last a long time, sound great and are pretty cheap.", "id": 156}, {"review": "Good strings.  They work and sound good.  I didn't notice much of a difference between these and run-of-the-mill D'Addario strings.", "id": 284}, {"review": "Works well - easily keeps my guitars humidified with less maintenance than other humidifiers I've had.", "id": 299}, {"review": "I don't use the other features, but as a tuner, this product is spot on.  Filters out noise well when using the mic.  Only two things to gripe with - 1.  The leg that you can use to prop this up isn't very usable. and 2. It's not great for gig use as the screen isn't that readable.As a home tuner or for a brightly-lit gig - excellent!", "id": 330}, {"review": "Dr. Duck's Ax Wax works great on all of my guitars, including my Nitro finished ones.  Can be hard to remove if you use too much, so apply only a few drops at a time.", "id": 348}, {"review": "Sturdy guitar stand that works equally well for electric or acoustic guitars.  The stands are well padded where they will touch the guitar, and while the back support wouldn't scratch a guitar anyway, it's nice that it lines up perfectly with a strat scratch plate.  These stands are a lot sturdier than you would think by the picture - mainly because the guitar sits very low.  This low center of gravity makes it less likely tip when knocked.  The guitar is at a little more of an angle than I am used to with other stands, but overall this is excellent - I've replaced all my stands with these.", "id": 132}]
