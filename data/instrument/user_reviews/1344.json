It just inconvenient that Amazon does list the product detail on the size of the screw head on top. Make sure your mic holder fits...", "id": 224}, {"review": "At last I got this mic after doing about a month of homework on which condenser mic to go for. If you're debating between the Blue Yeti, Snowball, Samson C01U, and this mic, there are plenty of reviews on youtube and google. At2020 was the most common one that people liked regarding affordability and sound quality.", "id": 254}, {"review": "This saved med at least $40 instead of getting a traditional pre-amp. Best invention ever!! Also portable. Downside is that is plastic and does seem fragile but I keep it with the condenser mic and all the fragile stuff.", "id": 538}, {"review": "I just got it today. Really tight because it's brand new, but it's really sturdy and solid. Nothing gimmicky or faulty, just perfect.", "id": 603}]
