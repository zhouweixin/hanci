[{"review": "This stand is designed to work on electric guitars, not acoustic or acoustic/electric guitars.  The arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars.  This is however perfect for my LP and SG guitars.  I love its size and portability.", "id": 91}, {"review": "This little guitar stand works very well.  I like it much better than the larger stands that support a guitar by the neck.", "id": 92}, {"review": "You know when a good quality item arrives, everything looks and works just as it is intended.  I love it ...", "id": 116}, {"review": "These strings are both smooth sounding and easy on the fingers.  My acoustic guitars seem to like them too, all except my 12-string. I have not switched form Martin strings on that guitar.", "id": 198}, {"review": "You know, I love the locking mechanisms on these guitar straps.  I own one of these (in differing colors and textures) for eack of my guitars.  I no longer experience the problem of the strap coming off while I'm playing.  That prevents a lot of damage.", "id": 208}, {"review": "I have several of these and they are both sturdy and dependable.  My acoustic and electric guitars are stable when held in the stand.", "id": 258}, {"review": "While this hanger is not unattractive, and is well built I could and will modify it to better suit my needs.  The design of the hanger causes the neck of the &#34;uke&#34; to stand off of the wall 2+ inches at the head and 3-1/2 inches at the hanger itself and 3 inches at the base of the body.  This is not an easy fix but it is doable.", "id": 788}]
