[{"review": "I have tried different brands and weights of strings in search of the ones that would give my guitar a clear, bright, yet robust sound, and I found that in the Martin MSP 4050 SP strings. I knew I had found, &#34;my strings&#34; after a short time playing with these. They are light on the fingers, sound great, and priced right.", "id": 58}, {"review": "I like purple, and it is purple. The strap is sturdy. It works, what else needs to be said; it arrived timely, is decent quality, and a nice color.", "id": 74}, {"review": "I like these even better than the Martin Custom Lights. They give off such a warm tone, and are holding up very well.", "id": 294}, {"review": "The only thing that would have been nicer and bumped the rating up would be to send a felt pad with the button. I used a rubber washer I had and that worked very well. It was easy to install.", "id": 478}, {"review": "While the sound improvement is not huge with my guitar, it didn't need to be. When it comes to music, it is&#34; that little extra&#34; that makes the difference. The Planet Waves O-Ports gives me that extra. I have no doubt it will continue to please me for many,many years to come.", "id": 704}]
