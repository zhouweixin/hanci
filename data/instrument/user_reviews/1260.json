[{"review": "I have always had trouble holding onto picks. My fingers just couldn't do it for extended play. Nothing worse than shaking your pick out of the body! LOL. I wish I would have thought of these. They were just what I needed. They work great.", "id": 503}, {"review": "Worth every penny. Great sound and stays in tune. Will definitely make any uke sound great. I replaced the stock strings on a MAKALA DOLPHIN with these and it sounds like a more expensive uke. They are easier on the fingers and stay in tune much better than the cheap strings that came with the uke. Definitely would recommend these.", "id": 698}, {"review": "It is okay. It serves the purpose. It is a good fit for the soprano uke. A pull tab for one of the zippers broke off within a week. Not a big deal I just stuck a zip tie in its place. The case is not a cheap trash bag style gig bag but a heavy nylon with some padding to it. It has a pocket on the front to hold some small gear. There is no support for the neck inside like in a guitar case. It will keep your uke from getting scratched or dusty, but will not provide much more protection than that.", "id": 845}, {"review": "I love this little tuner. It is smaller than I thought it would be. It weighs next to nothing, is accurate,  and easy to read with its bright large display. It is universal for different string instruments by pressing the botton on the back. The only part of the display that is very small is the one that tells you what instrument it is set for, but that was not a big enough issue for me to subtract points for.", "id": 846}, {"review": "Very comfortable. The soft yet thick leather ends will really protect the finish. Heavy duty but soft on the shoulder. Not cheap quality at all. This will definitely last a long time.", "id": 285}]
