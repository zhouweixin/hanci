[{"review": "tremendous mic!! love the case and shockmount being all inclusive.....got it at great price and its a kick ass addition to my rather wimpy home/portable studio.....love recording my mom and musical friends and they dig singing into a quality mic!!! I run it through an art tube preamp and it can make an unbelieveable hot signal without distortion and so very clear", "id": 159}, {"review": "these have worked great when I've needed to have 1/4 input vs the xlr......especially when I bust out the old Tascam 4 track cassette...some times I like recording drums analog versus digital or other instruments", "id": 249}, {"review": "great price and helped out with recording to a Tascam 4 track cassette (which I like using on occasion vs digital) and just plain useful with so many other apps......excellent budget dynamic mics and sweet case for storage!!!", "id": 405}, {"review": "this is a super beginners kit to get ya going and to build from.....the pencil condenser are questionable......they have picked up outside noise(like birds etc) but with a decent bit of white noise (but I may have had them running a bit hot too) the strange clamps have worked well for me", "id": 689}, {"review": "a very recent purchase....I have not used it yet so I can't say much...however I have loaded the software on my laptop...the software has soooo many capabilities its about mind boggling.....very good deal for newbies like me!!!", "id": 722}, {"review": "should have kept this....I returned it cause I purchased a zoom r16....big mistake!! miss it on smaller projects and my mxl990 sounded wonderful when hooked up to this super versital mixer.....my uncle has one and uses it for podcasts on his camping trips with vw freaks! he thinks it great too", "id": 782}, {"review": "it does a great job for the smallest of foggers available and low budget price.....works great with moonflowers and lasers I have gotten...the fogger enhances them greatly and is so worth the benefit it provides in regards to my lights....I really wanted to use it Halloween on treaters but it rained hard and didn't want it out on the porch.....next year!", "id": 256}]
