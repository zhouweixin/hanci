[{"review": "Price:Very reasonable price for what they do.Comfort:These stay on your head very well and are comfortable, I have not noticed ear irritation yet.Noise reduction:These are absolutely stellar at noise reduction. These block so much sound, you no longer have to blast your music to hear over your drums. They also don't distort out side sound. Some over ear headphones distort outside sound horribly.Sound quality:Crisp mid and high range. When it comes to the low end, these are lacking. And if you blast your music the low end distorts. But they block sound so well you don't have to blast them.Why not just buy in ear head phones, and over ear muffs?I have tried this many times due to not being able to find good head phones. It is very annoying, doesn't work very well, and looks pretty dumb too. These head phones are a much better solution.", "id": 146}, {"review": "These are good heads. I have played them on several drum sets and have been pleased with their sound, look and feel. This is a super solid price too.", "id": 395}, {"review": "This works, and I really like Evans. But I got 2 of these and they both looked different and looked cheap. Although I have been using it for awhile now with hard use and it is holding up great and saving my kick drum head from abuse.", "id": 73}, {"review": "I have always liked these sticks. They are solid, look good and feel good. You will always get quality from vic firth. Only downer is they seem to break faster then some sticks such as Vaders.", "id": 151}, {"review": "Works solid, looks solid, and had a good price. I would recommend it to anyone!I really like this pop filter.", "id": 697}]
