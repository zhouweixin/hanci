[{"review": "Wow, these cables are made really sturdy. And the noiseless feature is priceless. Definitely a real good value for the money.", "id": 32}, {"review": "Works really well! This is very convenient for when your on stage and are switching to fingering style or something. You can just drop the pick in your hands and pick a new one up when ready.", "id": 70}, {"review": "Great capo! I've tried a lot of other capos, including some pretty expensive brand name capos, and these are still unbeatable at keeping just the right pressure on the strings.", "id": 116}, {"review": "It isn't top of the line but it gets the job done. I wouldn't abuse of the chair too much though, the material looks a little floosy.", "id": 306}, {"review": "This is great for keeping your pedal board more organized. All you need is a power conditioner and you are ready to plug in.", "id": 428}, {"review": "These strings sound super awesome! I'm not sure what the engineering specifics are, but if your looking for responsive, easy on the fingers strings with nice bendability and sustainability, these puppies won't let you down.", "id": 679}, {"review": "I'm pretty active on stage and have had problems with cable breakage for years. (I haven't found a wireless unit that I feel comfortable with on stage yet) I was usually replacing the cable connected to my guitar about every three to four months until I purchased these. At first I purchased one just to check them out, but after six months. I decided to replace all of my guitar cables with these. There just so well made and much cheaper than other high end cables too. They last forever! Definitely worth the money!", "id": 803}]
