[{"review": "This mic is fine. One should know that it has quite low gain and requires the use of a boost/preamp for the guitar sound to be heard.", "id": 129}, {"review": "These are thin. They allow getting your pedals very close to each other, and let you optimize your pedal board space. I had other cables on my pedal boards. I replaced everything with those.", "id": 207}, {"review": "The unit I received did not work. I returned it. I like the other joyo pedals I ordered so I am going to give this one another shot.", "id": 834}, {"review": "This one sounds a bit nasal, and thin on guitar. I tried it on bass, and it gives you that big raw, ad thick stoner metal bass sound. I like it!", "id": 836}, {"review": "I have a bunch of instruments (synths, back up recordings, ...) plugged straight into my bass amp for home recording/practice.. Having this one helps reducing the amount of cabling hanging everywhere. It works fine. It is lightweight and feels sturdy.Only drawback: I tried getting straight into it with my musicman active bass, and the preamps saturated in low frequencies. Input has to be kept within a small range.", "id": 374}, {"review": "This is a very good piece of equipment for its price. Used mildly, it gives the sound a more natural feel.", "id": 758}]
