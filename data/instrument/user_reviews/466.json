[{"review": "It's a bit thinner than the average cable.Not as thick as I would like but works well and its kind of nice and slick to put away. Very smooth.", "id": 168}, {"review": "The Cable is good and normal . good price and works well. The rubber over the connecting ends tend to pull back and I have to push them in place all too often.", "id": 465}, {"review": "The cable tangles easily. Not stiff enough.It get's in the way and is hard to stay stretched out. But the color and the cloth cover is cool looking and has a more personal feel than the common rubber types. It also seem tightly put together at the ends.", "id": 876}, {"review": "It is lighter than most, fast and easy to set up and not bulky while strong and sturdy enough to support heavy 15&#34; speakers.The material and paint quality is not the greatest but the price is good and it will last long enough to worth the money especially for me gigging 4-6 times a week.", "id": 329}, {"review": "This worked well for me from about 25 to 30 feet. Sound was good and it was easy to set up.Good for the price and no regrets.", "id": 402}]
