[{"review": "I am very pleased with this music stand.  It is working well for me and it holds my very heavy music binders so far .  I would recommend it to others to try.", "id": 155}, {"review": "I say perfection, because this amp does exactly what I wanted it to do.  It is also a great value for what it does.  It offers ample volume for small venues.  I love having two mic inputs and the CD input.  The Behringer AT108, along with my Fender amp, gives me plenty of performance capability.", "id": 398}, {"review": "I love it.  It works great.  No ambient noise or clicks, as some have suggested.  It's as easy as, you plug it in and/or flip a switch for the desired effect, and voila it works.  So, duh, why do I need to say something moronic or interminable regarding this subject.  Just buy the product and get on with happy music making.  Thank you On-Stage.", "id": 537}, {"review": "The mic does exactly what I wanted it to do.  The mic has a headphone jack.  Having the headphone jack is essential to making quality recordings. Also, I like having the two polar patterns, switchable from cardioid to omni.I did have to back off a bit in proximity to the mic, as my voice is powerful.  Once, I got the hang of it I had no problems.I did find the bundled Cakewalk software useless.  Please refer to my review of\" Cakewalk Music Creator 6\" here on amazon.com.  It works great with my new \"Acoustica Mixcraft 5 Audio MIDI Music Recording Software V 5.\"Overall, this is an awesome product.", "id": 583}, {"review": "This was an excellent purchase.  Beside having a great range of audio pick-up, the mic is so versatile.
