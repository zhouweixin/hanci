[{"review": "I've been using these strings on my guitars for the last 30+ years.  They always give me consistent results.  I consider them one of the greatest bargains out there.", "id": 156}, {"review": "I put these strings on every acoustic I own.  They sound great and are priced right!  You can't go wrong with D'Addario strings!", "id": 198}, {"review": "Love this capo on my electric guitar.  I can adjust the tension for any position on the neck very easily.  Tried other more expensive capos, but this one is the Winner!", "id": 304}, {"review": "I've been playing the guitar since the 1960's, so I've gone through plenty of guitar stands.  Always found the hanging-type to be the safest & most secure.  For a long time I was using the Hamilton chrome hanging stand.  When I first saw these being used by all the guitar players at the church I attend (Christ Community Church, St Charles, IL), I decided to give them a look.  The build quality is very good and all the sections that come in contact with the guitar (Electric or Acoustic) are padded with a foam material to prevent scratching/ denting.  It offers a very solid support and I feel safe putting my guitar on it.  This is the only type of stand I prefer to use.  I do wish it wasn't made in China, too much of our money goes to that country (just my opinion).  The bottom line is that I am very happy with this stand and would recommend it to any guitar player who wants a sturdy, well built stand that keeps the guitar safe and should last for ever.", "id": 337}, {"review": "I've been using the Schaller Strap Locks on my guitars since the 1980's.  They give me a sense of security, knowing that my guitar strap is totally secured to my guitar.  I consider it cheap insurance.", "id": 278}]
