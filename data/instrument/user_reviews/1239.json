[{"review": "This is my second Spectraflex cable and I love them. I love their flexibility, options for colors and ends, build quality and price. I like to use quality guitar cables for a good sound but I don't need to spend a fortune on them to be run over on stage by roadies or ripped off because the cable costs more than some guitars do.", "id": 47}, {"review": "This polish works well for what I need it for. I am not a clean freak but I take good care of my instruments and this works well not only to remove the crud and fingerprints from a gig, but puts a nice shine on the guitar without having to work to hard with the polish to get there.", "id": 351}, {"review": "This is great idea to clean guitar strings. I've always wiped down the necks of my guitars but this allows you to clean the underside of the strings as well as the top.Simple to use, small to fit inside a case or gig bag and not expensive.Using this will help lengthen the life of your strings and pay for itself in no time.", "id": 543}, {"review": "This cable is a great cable for the price.Flexible, good tone, good quality.I move around alot on stage and I need cables that will keep up with me and not bind up.Great product", "id": 586}, {"review": "I just started playing banjo and did not want to wrap up tons of money in supplies.
