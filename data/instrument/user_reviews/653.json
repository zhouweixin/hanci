[{"review": "This headstand works like a charm. It's simple, portable, and sturdy. P.s. to the people complaining about it falling over...I have no idea what you're doing with your guitars, but mine is very stable. Plus all headstands are a bit wobbly and I've used just about every brand. For the price, you can't complain.", "id": 163}, {"review": "once i used these picks for the first time, i never could use different picks ever again! and its a great price, BUY THEM!", "id": 455}, {"review": "This mic is absolutely awesome! It looks and feels SO high quality. The sound is stunning. It could be a tiny bit better for the price, but I'm absolutely pleased with it overall. Best mic in this price range by far!", "id": 525}, {"review": "Genius idea that I wish I thought of first. I actually super glued mine to my work desk to make it permanent, but it has plenty of grip all by itself to securely hold your guitar in place. I would definitely recommend!", "id": 746}, {"review": "This guitar tuner is simply AMAZING!!! I feel like I should have paid at least 50 bucks for this thing, but $13 is practically a freaking steal! The display is so nice, the quality is amazon, and this thing is beyond accurate! Never using another tuner again in my life. SNARK forever!", "id": 811}]
