[{"review": "Filter is of good size (6\") and easily comes apart for changing the fabric (I will probably use panty hose) if it gets torn. Other than that it works so what more can be said", "id": 46}, {"review": "Bought this for my Dot. It fits snugly and is adequately padded. The outer material is strong so I feel comfortable carrying and storing my guitar in it. A must if your already paying so much more for the Guitar that will go in it.", "id": 157}, {"review": "I have never been let down by Ernie Ball strings. They produce a bright clear sound and for every other string in their price range they are the best way to go. I only use them and I have been playing for a decade.They stay in tune forever and have a warm sound characteristic of nickle strings.Whenever I buy a new guitar and change out the factory strings I am always shocked at how much better my instrument sounds.", "id": 226}, {"review": "This device functions wonderful but the beeping of the metronome could be a little louder and of a more pleasant tone (sounds like a 1980's video game beep) but I am just being picky. I bought this for my son and he loves it.", "id": 298}, {"review": "Excellent Quality and Craftsmanship.I was expecting less of this product for its price and the job it will do, I figured it would be made out of a \"cheap\" feeling metal. I was wrong. It is very stable and steady and feels like good steel or aluminum maybe. It is strong to. It feels like I could really bang it (I won't) and it would not break.I use this with an Audio Technica AT2020 which screws in perfectly snug but is still rotatable on the base. The mount holds it firm and keeps the mic still. It does eliminate a little vibration but if you pound on your desk (or whatever)that will still come through. It looks cool too (and everybody knows that matters). I am very pleased with this purchase.", "id": 393}, {"review": "This is a cool little amp for practicing in a small room or playing to a small group of people.It produces some nice warm tones and can get loud enough for jamming with but is good if you don't want to be too loud. It has a headphone jack also. I like this so much I might experiment with miking it for gigs, never thought I would say that about a 10 watt.Fender choose quality over bells and whistles with this one. There is an overdrive on/off button with adjustable gain, volume control and a simple treble/bass equalizer. Other then that it is all rock. Physically it is built strong too.", "id": 564}]
