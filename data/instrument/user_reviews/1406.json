[{"review": "Impressed with this set, I installed them today and have been playing for a few hours. My wife thinks my guitar looks better now, and I agree. Im not sure if they are supposed to be flush, and they stick out just a little bit but they have not popped out. I think my guitars tone has improved a little too, but I also installed new strings. Qualtiy is way better then the plastic pins!", "id": 206}, {"review": "We have used them for three shows and a bunch of practices. Sounds great, looks great, the cable tie straps are nice and the connectors fit into the microphone nice and tight. Even fixed another bands vox mic connector, his sure cable was loose in the connector, this cable was tight. Has worked on...SM57, Nady Starpower, AKG 5800s, MXL 990, Marshall and Mark bass amps, and every one had a nice tight clean connection on the XLR's and on the numerous mixers. And yes COLOR RULES!", "id": 424}, {"review": "These picks are great, the best part is the 72 pack. I always have spares. This is a thicker pick, I would recomend you actualy try one before you by 72 of them. The only complaint comes from my wife, since they tend to pop up all over the house!", "id": 455}, {"review": "It works perfect with Cakewalk Music creator 5 and a Digitech vocalist. Best price out there.", "id": 565}, {"review": "Looks nice, hardware is good, and it works great on that extra guitar you might have without the need to buy the whole set. Now I have one strap and can swap guitars fast and not worry about dropping my guitar!", "id": 630}]
