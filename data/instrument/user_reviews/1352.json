[{"review": "No problems at all with this product.  Works well with the five string bass and amp purchased from Amazon.  I would recommend this product.", "id": 168}, {"review": "It's nice for my son to be able to stand his five string bass up in his room on display, while still having it be kept safe.  It helps him remember to practice when he sees it.", "id": 519}, {"review": "These guitar picks are just the right thickness and stiffness for comfortable playing.  The colors are nice as well.  I would recommend these.", "id": 574}, {"review": "The compactf design of this tuner makes it easy to take with you to lessons, school, or a gig.  Works well.", "id": 820}, {"review": "Good basic strap.  It's not fancy, but it doesn't need to be.  By being just plain black, it tends not to detract from the good looks of the five string bass it's used on.", "id": 208}, {"review": "Good basic first amp.  Great for practicing in the bedroom without bothering everyone in the house!  Compact size makes storage easy.", "id": 721}]
