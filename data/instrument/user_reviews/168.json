[{"review": "these are wonderful strings for acoustic playing.  They have a great sound for finger picking and even with a pick they still sound good.", "id": 409}, {"review": "This stand, after I finally figured out how to attach it so that it didn't interfere with the boom on my mic stand, works okay.  Due to its heaviness, it does hold a good size amount of music;  however, it is short, width-wise, so you can't really get an open notebook to stay in place.  (at least not with the ,mic boom there).  Heavy to travel with also, so I don't know how much I'll use it.", "id": 592}, {"review": "this is a good quality cable and works just as I expected it to.  I like the extra cable 'clips' that came with it so I can keep it wrapped up untangled.", "id": 692}, {"review": "This is the best capo I've ever owned.  It's a little awkward in that it doesn't just clip to the headstock with one hand, and it takes me two hands also to put it on, but not having to retune my 12-string makes it all worthwhile! I like the choice of colors too.", "id": 121}, {"review": "This works just as stated.  Now I can plug my mic in either way,  and it gives me more versitility", "id": 249}]
