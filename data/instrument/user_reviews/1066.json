[{"review": "These strings sound amazing. They also last for a really long time and keep sounding amazing. I get better harmonics with these strings as well.", "id": 105}, {"review": "This mic is really nice. I have used it on many recordings and it still amazes me that it can sound so great. Works great on voice overs, singers, and rappers.That said, it won't outperform the mics you would encounter in studios today, but with a little tweaking, and the right preamp, this mic can sound great.There was one review that mentioned it isn't for female vocalists. I've only used it on one and it sounded great, not as good as the one I used in studio, but it worked in a pinch for overdubbing with no studio time available.", "id": 371}, {"review": "Works with a lot of mics, and, with a little modding, it worked with my MXL V67G; which is all I needed it for.", "id": 393}, {"review": "I have played guitar for about 12 years and these picks are now my favorite picks ever. I can't really explain why, they just feel right. Sometimes they break, but what pick light pick doesn't unless it's nylon?", "id": 574}, {"review": "It works as a pop filter should and is a huge upgrade over my make-shift panty hose pop filter.
