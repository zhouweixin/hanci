Never can have enough because they seem to be prone to theft! :)", "id": 574}, {"review": "This thing works great.  Tiny and seems to be accurate.  The price is darn good as well.  A must for all guitarists.", "id": 706}, {"review": "Not knowing much, and after using for a couple of months, I'm pretty happy with guitar for the money I paid for it.  Fit and finish is quite nice.  Just needed tuning.  Great beginner model.  Feels solid and stay's in tune after the first 4 or 5 practice sessions.", "id": 754}]
