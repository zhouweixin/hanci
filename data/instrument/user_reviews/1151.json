[{"review": "No much to these things, but they are cheap and they work great in the studio.  They shipped quickly and didn't break the bank.", "id": 258}, {"review": "I bought 3 of these because of the ridiculously low price...I figured I'd get my money's worth from them regardless.  They work fine.  So well, that I thought I would buy a few more for the studio.  The price went up nearly 50% on them though.  BAH.", "id": 310}, {"review": "Works like it's supposed to.  Although I should have just got the universal instrument tuner.  This one only tunes in the uke keys.", "id": 763}, {"review": "I own at least 8 of these.  I use them on all of my instruments, including banjo, mandolin, guitar, and Ukelele.  For the price, they cannot be beat, and they leave a small footprint too.", "id": 811}, {"review": "I bought this as an interface between my mixer, instruments, and mics to my Macbook for Garageband.  You have to go in and change the input and output in OSX, but it works great!", "id": 801}]
