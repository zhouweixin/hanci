I have them on several bass cabinets, they also remove easily for stationary cabinet use.", "id": 542}, {"review": "Very well made cable but I had to return it for a longer one of the same as this was a little to short, but very well made .", "id": 586}, {"review": "Works great and does a good job, a must have type tool for the price get one !!! Light takes up little space and easy to use .", "id": 762}, {"review": "Rugged ends very flexible seem like this cable should hold up very well , does not tangle which is a real plus if you tend to move around a lot , connectors seem to be heavy duty , time will tell but I would assume that this cable should last a long time .", "id": 47}]
