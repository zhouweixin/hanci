[{"review": "Only issue they break easily. But they last a long time and sound great. Well worth the money. Crisp and fresh tone for a long time.", "id": 198}, {"review": "This stand surprised my. It is lightweight but is still sturdy. I wouldn't venture to use it on the road all the time. But as a backup stand I wouldn't hesitate. I like it much better than my musicians gear stand though if this had a double extendable boon it would be perfect.", "id": 279}, {"review": "I love these strings they are a little more mellow than most mando strings so they sit in the mix and let the guitars cut though a little more. I'm hoping they last a while!", "id": 338}, {"review": "I love these cables. I ordered two about a year and change ago and they are my main cables for my bass and guitar rigs. They are still perfect and they get used for many hours each day", "id": 492}, {"review": "This is the equivalent to the Shure SM-57 except for a quarter of the price. The quality is almost the same and in terms of recording they are pretty much the same as well. There allow a more natural sound than the SM57 I believe and are thus a better product!", "id": 594}, {"review": "I absolutely love these strings. I'm used to playing higher tension strings and these fit the bill perfectly. They have a great full sound and after breaking them in after a couple weeks of playing they give a really good classic P bass sound. Its not for people who want the modern brighter sound but for the classic 50s 60s and 70s sound these are great!", "id": 664}, {"review": "Possibly the best quality mic cable I have come across to date in my hunt for reasonably priced cables and gear. For the working musician or home recording man this is great! Extremely high quality at this price point and are used by professionals all over Southern California and the nation!", "id": 692}]
