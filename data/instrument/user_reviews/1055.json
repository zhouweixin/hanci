Very portable and does the job it was designed to do.", "id": 368}, {"review": "I got this to plug into my computer. It comes with a wealth of programs and amp combos. The unit itself works as planned even though i think i may stick with Sonar as far as a editor. Sorry Behringer maybe later. The quality and durability are there 100% well worth what i paid for.", "id": 418}, {"review": "I just bought it records very well even a whisper from pretty far away.

Easy to use and handy for ANY string instruments.Only thing i regret is not getting one sooner.", "id": 707}, {"review": "I had the red Snark and a couple others. This one is the best ive tried so far. No problems and does give you a tighter faster tuning. 6 stars if they had it that high.", "id": 811}, {"review": "Is a good stand. Relatively small but is a secure. The locking top is a good feature as well. Id recommend this over the larger tubular type.", "id": 519}]
