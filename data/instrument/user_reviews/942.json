[{"review": "If you are using two or more pedal effects this should be on your standard equipment list  With the price of 9volt batteries you can't afford not to purchase this rig.  If you need it, there's enough wiring to have space between your pedals. But the wiring is thin enough to be able to stuff it into a crammed pedal board.  A great feature is the disconnect plug that gives you the ability to disconnect the wiring harness from the 9volt adapter  The 9volt adaptor comes with plenty of wire so you can have your pedals or board in a convenient position.", "id": 428}, {"review": "If you're not using a pedal board these are just what you need. Good price....Good quality. I use them for the times that a short patch cord is better then tripping over longer cables.  I use them to patch-in additional effects outside of my pedal board and they're perfect for patching my amp head to a slave head.  BUT!!!.... If you're building a pedal board  AMAZON sells, solid, double- male,  connecters (Digitech PC-2 Hardwire Accessory Premium Gold Plated 1/4\" Male Coupler) that work great and really clean-up your pedal board.", "id": 578}, {"review": "It isn't the softest strap. But the width makes it feel better till it's &#34;broken-in&#34;. Good leather that should last a long time.  I have very similer straps that have lasted 30+ years.", "id": 661}, {"review": "Who would have thought you could buy \"quality\" bass guitar strings from the same place you can buy your DVDs?The strings are, with out a doubt, real Fender strings. And even with shipping coasts they are STILL comparably-priced if not cheaper then buying them at a nationaly franchised music store.But...Because you don't have the opportunity to compare strings; I do recommend that you know what you want.I've also purchased \"top shelf\" guitar stings, as well as a variety of other products, from AMAZON and have ALWAYS been satisfied with the qualiy and service.", "id": 664}, {"review": "A VERY handy item. Great for sitting by your practice amp when you don't want to be bothered with stepping all over your 10footers.  The wire could be a little heavier but you can't beat the value. The plugs are the standard screw-down type with well soldered  joints.  I've used this, now, for quite a while and have no problems nor complaints with this cord.", "id": 419}, {"review": "By recommendation, from the Acoustic tech people, I purchased this for my Acoustic 300B.  Unfortunately it was the Wong switch. BUT&#62;&#62;&#62;It has true FENDER quality.  Well built. Heavy duty construction. The switches are rock solid. This switch can withstand some heavy, quick switch, action.. Rubber, no skid, bottom is a plus. I KEPT the switch because of the quality. I know It will come in handy sooner or later.  .", "id": 535}, {"review": "This Power-Grip Pedalboard Mounting Tape is VELCRO ON STEROIDS!!!  This product makes your pedals SUPER SECURE.  The tape backing is first rate heavy adhesive and the gripping &#34;teeth&#34; would make The &#34;JAWS&#34; shark envious.Word of advice;  Make sure you have your pedals arranged the exact way that you want them before you start mounting them to the board. Once down you can pretty much count on an ALMOST PERMENT MOUNTING.And a hint;  Some pedals (like Behringer) have a rubber bottom. Remove these rubber &#34;non-skid&#34; plates because they come off too easily.Also; AMAZON sells &#34;couplers&#34;.  These take less room  and cut down on the clutter.As a matter of fact, AMAZON sells EVERY THING YOU NEED to put together a Pro Board.", "id": 765}]
