[{"review": "This thing is awesome! really nice looking, and heavy duty. Costs a few bucks, but is very high quality, seems like it will last for ever.", "id": 253}, {"review": "I love the tone! do your research though! Plenty of distortion, plenty of bass and treble, makes my tubescreamers sound like a band pass filter!", "id": 453}, {"review": "I have one setting that I like, and the only button or knob I use is to turn it on or off. Would never use it to record, but for the price it is 100% an awesome choice! Totally sufficient for a live situation if your amp doesn't have reverb, or you just want to easily turn reverb on or off.", "id": 699}, {"review": "This is the most awesome loop pedal ever!!! does the trick perfect, you can remove and add in elements to your loop! super small, only potential drawback is that it cannot be battery powered.", "id": 869}, {"review": "Spend a few extra bucks and get a music stand that is sturdier! these can't support heavy stuff and will knock over SO easily. They sure are portable though. not a bad idea to keep one in your car just in case since it folds up to be so tiny!", "id": 230}]
