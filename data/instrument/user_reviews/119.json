[{"review": "I have had these on a Les Paul for years and just purchased some more for the rest of my guitars.  Does what it says it will do - keeps your strap locked on.  I have had zero issues with these.  The installation takes 2 minutes, and has stood up to countless hours of play.  Highly recommended!", "id": 44}, {"review": "This cable is dirt cheap, but the quality seems to be just fine.  I am using it for my primary rig setup and I can't tell the different between this and some other cables.  Recommended.", "id": 168}, {"review": "For the price you cannot go wrong with this.  Holds my Les Paul and feels secure.  I've never had any issues with this.  Don't bother spending 3-4x as much for something that does the job as well as this.EDIT - Bought another one this Christmas for another guitar and this one feels as good and as simple as the first one.", "id": 258}, {"review": "If you need a simple, normal-length strap, this should work fine.  However, if you are tall and like to sling the guitar a bit on the low side, this is not what you need.  I bought this but wound up ordering theErnie Ball 4037 Black Polypro Strapinstead.  Very similar look and feel, but the Ernie Ball is MUCH longer.  The lowest I could get this to hang was just above my waist.  Again, not a bad strap, just not for us tall guys :)", "id": 285}, {"review": "This is just what it looks like - a very economical strap.  The great thing about it is the length.  As any other tall person will tell you, finding a strap that adjusts to longer than normal can be frustrating.  This strap is very long, if you need it to be.  For the price, very hard to beat this.  Works well withDunlop Dual Design Straplok System, Blacktoo.  Overall, a good buy, for a backup strap or your primary.", "id": 74}]
