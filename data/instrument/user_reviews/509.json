[{"review": "I had bought one a few years ago when i was a little short on cash, I was very skeptical that this would work for me, After my guy set it up it played flawlessly to say the least, Once i got my tele back and my acoustic Gibson back, (the life of a out of work guitar player, always the pawn shops best customer) but i was able to incorporate the Dean in with both of them, And it gave me another electric to play, This cheap little Dean guitar has turned into a favorite for me, Plug it in and sit back and enjoy what comes out of it, Very crisp with no noise, So if your looking for a good cheap guitar to either learn on or just something that you can pick up and play, And i have never had anyone tell me that it sounded horrible, And it got me through some tough times, That is why i just bought another one for practice, I hope that you will be able to use this review for your decision, Bottom line you can't go wrong with this guitar.......................PEACE", "id": 111}, {"review": "I cant tell you how impressed i am with this mini amp, I was expecting some little amp with a somewhat of a sound, Instead I couldn't put it away, I must have played for at least a couple of hours in complete awe, The tones you were able to achieve with just a little knob adjustment was amazing,I would recommend this to anyone that needs a cheap amp, The 9v battery holds up well (which is surprising considering the drive you got off it)So spend the $20.00 and get something that is a real deal, I hope this helps with your decision about purchasing one", "id": 303}, {"review": "If your a Beatle fan or just someone who collects picks, This is the perfect item for you, Great graphics, I'm a guitar pick collector, And this is by far the best that i have, So if you don't have this Beatle set go and get it.", "id": 669}, {"review": "not much to say, if you play guitar buy one, you'll never be out of tune again, lets you tune anytime, i never even take mine off, no more \"does this sound in tune\" because it will always be in tune, so do your self a favor and go out and buy one, very affordable (you could collect enough cans to buy this in a couple hours)so enjoy", "id": 706}, {"review": "I JUST RECEIVED MY 10 PACK PLANET WAVES BEATLE COLLECTORS PICK, GRAPHICS ARE GREAT, IT'S A GREAT LITTLE COLLECTION, ONLY THING THAT I DIDN'T LIKE WAS THAT YOU DIDN'T GET 15 SEPARATE ONES, THEY ARE ALL DUPLICATES, SO BESIDES THAT THEY ARE GREAT", "id": 614}]
