[{"review": "Watch the review in one of the prior posts for fitting it properly to the Yeti microphone.  Works like a champ, gets rid of all those unwanted noises!  Larger than I expected.", "id": 200}, {"review": "I love these hanging Hercules Guitar Hangers!  The work wonderfully.  When you place your guitar into the hanger, little supports turn in to each other creating a safe secure hanger.  Works great in studs, drywall, and stucco (with the correct hardware of course).", "id": 289}, {"review": "1 Digital Drumset, 1 Electronic guitar, 1 microphone (non XLR), and a Keyboard.  I got the Brady Bunch Musical here.  This mixer works great. No complaints, just works!  All connections are 1/4\" mono.", "id": 374}, {"review": "These cables work well for my guitar, keyboard and drums.  They appear to hold up well under constant moving.  I will be getting more.", "id": 419}, {"review": "Not the best pedal out there, but for the price...it's pretty freakin' awesome!  Love the 20 second looper and the ability to turn wah on and off by depressing the volume pedal all the way forward.  Solid sounds and cabinets!", "id": 590}, {"review": "This microphone in just a few words IS AWESOME.  The sound recorded by this device in all modes left nothing to be desired for me.  I use this mic for voice over work that gets added to videos playing in major hotel rooms.  Superior mic!", "id": 644}]
