[{"review": "I have used monster cables for years, and with good reason. The lifetime warranty is worth the price alone. Simple fact: cables break, but getting to replace them at no cost is where it's at.", "id": 1}, {"review": "I've tried a few different straplock options and these are the best. Not only do they securely hold the strap to the guitar they also look pretty good. Highly recommend.", "id": 44}, {"review": "Love these picks. Have used them for years. Feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever. Highly recommend.", "id": 61}, {"review": "For your money I can't recommend the EQ enough. It's cheap, works well, and is small enough as to not clutter your pedalboard.", "id": 84}, {"review": "I've been using these strings for years. Tried a bunch of others as well, but these suckers keep coming out on top. Probably will never stop buying them.", "id": 156}, {"review": "I've purchased many of these cables and I'll be getting more eventually. Cables, even good ones, eventually break. These are quite flexible, seem durable, and are by a brand name. If you need cables, these work great.", "id": 168}, {"review": "My acoustic only has the end pin strap button and none at the heel of the neck. I was using a bit of string to tie the strap to the headstock, but it was ugly. This, however, is a very attractive solution and quite sturdy to boot. Highly recommend.", "id": 877}, {"review": "In my opinion this is one of the finest pedals to exist. The crybaby is still on my pedalboard and will be for as long as I can foresee.", "id": 41}]
