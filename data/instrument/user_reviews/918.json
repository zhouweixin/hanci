[{"review": "I have a collection of straps but not a black one.  This one matches the acoustic/electric I bought perfectly.  The pick holder is a nice addition to the strap that none of my other straps have.  I would buy fromthis company again.  Thank You.", "id": 285}, {"review": "I believe I've rated this instrument before.  I really like that it plays easily and has a good sound to it.  I also like the fact that it doesn't require a 9 Volt Battery whereas others I played did.  I would buy from this company again and probally will in the future.  Thank You.", "id": 714}, {"review": "These were just what I needed.  Over the years, some of the bridge pins on my 12-Sttring Acoustic Guitar have broken and had to be replaced.  Some of them had the white dot, some didn't, therefore, they didn't look uniform.  With these pins, the guitar now looks like it did when I bought it.  Thank You.

I have two(2) other tuners I bought from Wal-Mart and I always get accurate tunings from them.  I bought this KORG because it's a brand name and the Company has an outstanding reputation. Even though my tow(2) Wal-Mart tuners are older, they both still work better than this KORG.", "id": 331}, {"review": "I'm enjoying it.  I actually bought it keep my amp off the floor but I also like that it puts the amp at an angle pointing upwards.  It's supporting my 50 pound amp easily and hasn't tilted back or fallen over.  I'm glad I bought it and would buy from the company again.  Thank You.", "id": 517}]
