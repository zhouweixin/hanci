[{"review": "I would say this stand is for the occasional user who doesn't put more weight than a few sheets of paper on it.The top part is not secured. It just slides on the tip of the tripod. Pick it up and carry it around, it'll come apart and scratch your Stradivarius.The foot is horrible: It sort of hooks in place with a little clamp. That means, you get ONE position. And that one doesn't look like it will live very long.Comes in a pouch, which helps to put it away.Spend more if you can.", "id": 230}, {"review": "It's okay. I've bought stands for less that were more balanced and sturdy, and the little &#34;safety&#34; strap is a nuisance more than a help.", "id": 258}, {"review": "Screws are starting to wear out after about 3 months of use. The black covering of the metal is starting to show wear. To be expected, but I'm sure you'll appreciate hearing that this is not one of those miracle deals where you get something amazing for the money. It is what it is, and not much more.", "id": 279}, {"review": "This little foot stool is really sturdy. It stays in place beautifully. No rocking sideways, no wobbly action.If one of the notches doesn't do it for you, you're screwed: There's no gradual adjustment. But the positions it allows make sense for 99% of players.", "id": 321}, {"review": "For this price, you owe it to yourself to get at least one of these little things, better yet, get one for each guitar you own.They're reliable and easy to use. And ACCURATE!!!You can mount these in such a way that the display points to be back of the headstock. That way, they're easy to read and don't screw up the look of your guitar.Why no 5 star review? Because they're battery eaters. The provided battery lasts for about a month, then starts dimming. Not cool. A rechargeable version would be good.", "id": 724}]
