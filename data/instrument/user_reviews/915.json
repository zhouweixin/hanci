It is worth the money in my opinion.", "id": 266}, {"review": "I bought the capo for the guys at a correctional facility that I work for. It gets abused, so I don't look for it to last long. Would not buy it for my own guitar.", "id": 346}, {"review": "The monster chord is great looking, but for me, they are too stiff. I play an acoustic guitar, so I don't run around a lot. The cord must be made to be able to take some abuse, but I don't need that.", "id": 126}, {"review": "I usually use Martin SP's, but I decided to give these a try. I'm pleased with them, but I would not rank them above the SP's. I did a little recording with them and I have to admit, they sounded a little brittle.", "id": 160}, {"review": "I love the Elixir strings. They sound great and play easy. I would recommend them to anyone. Give them a try..", "id": 295}]
