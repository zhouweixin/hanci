[{"review": "I agree with the others reviews.  The sponge is too small and too thin but the humidify is small so it wouldn't fit any larger sponges.  Okay for the price.", "id": 71}, {"review": "Well it's a cloth and I use it to wipe my guitar.  This is a fairly good size cloth at that.", "id": 184}, {"review": "The strap is of good quality and since its new it still feel stiff but I am happy that I got it.", "id": 657}, {"review": "Not sure if it did improve my sound or not.  I have a fender dreadnought acoustic and I couldn't really tell that much.  Maybe just a little.", "id": 704}, {"review": "It fits well, close well, protects well, transport well! What more can I ask from a guitar case that cost a fraction of the other cases.  Have not have it that long to rate the durability but I like this case.", "id": 753}]
