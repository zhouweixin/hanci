Adjusts easily, nice width, comfy enough for me...(I ordered one and had a problem with the pins lining up and had to exchange it for another one.  Sam Ash was very courteous in fixing the problem. )", "id": 362}, {"review": "Do you like to shift your booty around on the seat?  You can't with this!  It's too narrow at 17 inches.  I am going with a wider one.  (other than that is seems decent)Updated March 4th, 2014: I ordered the On Stage KT7800 and have had it for several weeks now.  I am much happier with it, and it is easier to adjust.  The first one I ordered was defective and I had to send it back, butt now I am good to go.", "id": 464}, {"review": "Very sturdy stand made to last a lifetime.  Easy enough to adjust and can hold a lot of weight.  Cannot go wrong with this one.", "id": 604}, {"review": "Works very well and is portable.
