[{"review": "This works very good on a silver flute.  It's soft and will go along time before you feel like you have to launder it.  Would purchase again.", "id": 184}, {"review": "Our teenager really likes these.  As a beginner guitar player he likes the variety and was able to find out what types of picks he prefers.  Have not broken one yet.", "id": 574}, {"review": "Got this for a 15 year old learning guitar.  They thought the guitar was fine before the tuner.  My, how things change when you can see what is really going on.  Recommended.", "id": 707}, {"review": "This works fine on a standard guitar.  No issues whatever.  I see other reviewers having issues.  Not sure if that's from rough handling.  But for casual use this one is completely fine.", "id": 837}, {"review": "Alot of Zoom H1 users put this over their mics.  The fit is nearly perfect.  For that application this is THE windscreen to get.  Works great.", "id": 178}, {"review": "Well, without a tuner like this someone playing woodwinds might not even realize how a number of notes, usually in the lower octaves, are a little off.  With cheaper made instruments like school instruments you would be surprised.  This tuner helps you not only start in tune but also develop some strategies to deal with those sour notes.  The fact that it works on guitars also just makes it worth the extra few dollars.  Highly recommended.  And it looks great too.", "id": 861}]
