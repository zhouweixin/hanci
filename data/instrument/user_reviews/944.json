[{"review": "I wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the trick. My guitar would probably not be happy without it.", "id": 71}, {"review": "In general it's OK but when you look at the fine writing on the fingerboard formula it says not to use on Maple; which means I can't use it on either of my Gibsons.  Probably better to just get the lemon oil for that separately.", "id": 95}, {"review": "It doesn't seem to work. I think maybe mine was damaged or something because it doesn't seem to absorb any water.", "id": 314}, {"review": "Definitely holds the guitar well . a little pricey but probably worth it. I'm a fan of Dunlop in general but think they got it right with this one.", "id": 550}, {"review": "It's a pretty cool little gizmo. The clip on feature is really helpful too; makes me wonder what I did before I had one.", "id": 762}, {"review": "I'm happy with them. SO much easier having my guitars in a stand i can grab when I want. These stands are decent quality and pretty reasonably priced.", "id": 813}, {"review": "Makes the fretboard feel like new; but best to clean with alcohol wipes first. I think most woods will appreciate being treated with this oil; especially in dry environments.", "id": 234}]
