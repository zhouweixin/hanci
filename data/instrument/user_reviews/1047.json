[{"review": "This little stand collapses and sets up so easy.  Holds my guitar perfectly.  May buy one for my dad next!", "id": 92}, {"review": "I purchased these to use with my mandolin. They are ok.  I personally prefer a little stiffer pick, but my kids have been using them with their Uke's so all in all not a bad purchase.", "id": 243}, {"review": "This stand is a little difficult to open.  The top the gets very stuck and turned the wrong way.  Other than that the stand collapses very small into the black bag that came with it.", "id": 313}, {"review": "We purchased these because they were recommended to be used with the Ukulele.  They seem to make a damper sound rather than allowing the strings to make music.  Not sure I would buy these again. But great to give the kids when I don't want to hear 6 Uke's practicing at the same time.", "id": 775}, {"review": "I have them in purple which makes them stick out.  They have the little cut out to make it easier to grip and hold when I am playing the mandolin.  Already planning on purchasing more.", "id": 66}, {"review": "I needed a small capo for my mandolin and so I purchased this little guy. Works great, though I have to put it on at that 1st fret and then move it up to where I need it.", "id": 356}, {"review": "My kids are all interested in learning the Uke.  This one really appealed to my son because of the front design.  Plays well and keeps in tune.", "id": 589}, {"review": "This was a Christmas gift from my husband.  It is such cool and easy rest for the guitar.  I took it with me to our bi weekly jam and the other musicians were considering buying some for themselves.", "id": 746}]
