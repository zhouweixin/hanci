[{"review": "I bought a Hollowbody without a case and wanted a gig bag in case I decided to take it anywhere. The prices of the other bags ranged from more than double this one to almost four times. I have other guitars and they all have cases and I might never actually take this guitar anywhere so I didn' twant to spend a lot. Price was a big issue. The guitar fits great. The bag is well padded and I can't believe the price.", "id": 309}, {"review": "It's the same as the other flavors, which all work fine, but it looks great with my new white Gretch.", "id": 661}, {"review": "The right pick is a personal preference. Nothing wrong with Dunlop Stubby Pick, but it's not for me. I bought a pack of 2.0mm  picks last year and loved them but left them in Florida when I went north. I forgot the name of my favorite pick and bought these by mistake.", "id": 66}, {"review": "Works good, nothing special. I have to say I disagree with a couple of reviews which complained about a bad smell. My big nose can't confirm that. Maybe they corrected the problem if one exited.", "id": 258}, {"review": "I was still searching for a pick to replace the ones I left somewhere. I knew these were not the ones I sought, but they are great. They don't move around in my hand, I have yet to drop one, and for the first time I noticed that a pick can make a difference in the sound of a guitar. These sound great. I've found a new favorite pick.", "id": 503}]
