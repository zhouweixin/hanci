Nice and solid.", "id": 279}, {"review": "It's a short boom, but it works great. I really like the way it locks with interlocking teeth rather than simply tightening.", "id": 291}, {"review": "XLR cables are hard to mess up...these are great. They do the trick. Why bother making your own cables when you can buy them already made this cheap?", "id": 439}, {"review": "Great quality. I bought this at the same time as another 7.1 HD USB sound card, but that one break. This one has lasted. My only complaint is that even with the sound all the way down to 1, it is still fairly loud and I end up turning down the volume in whatever app I'm using.", "id": 569}, {"review": "I own a Native Instruments Maschine Mikro...but find myself using this even more often. You can program it to whatever MIDI values you want. The pads themselves are as solid as devices several times more expensive.", "id": 628}, {"review": "Sold, great quality XLR Mic. It's pretty hard to mess these up. People often build their own, but when they're this cheap, why go through the trouble?", "id": 465}]
