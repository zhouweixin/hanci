[{"review": "these dunlop straploks are amazing! never had them fail on me, and always gave me a good piece of mind knowing that my guitar is safe from hitting the floor on stage or at home, they stay secure when done properly, I've looked at other strap locks and tried some others but the dunlop ones just seem to work, and work well.", "id": 44}, {"review": "I've always used these dunlop picks, I've tried other ones like fender, other dunlop picks as well but these just feel right, I've never like the thicker picks or the picks with the weird grips on them these just feel right when playing, give them a try! ... if not you'll just wind up with a cool little turtle tortex sticker instead", "id": 61}, {"review": "these Fender pickguard screws are excellent, they work well with any project you may be doing at the moment, I replaced these with the squier standard screws on my strat and they're much better than the ones you get on the squier guitars made better and with a small screw face the keep your axe looking excellent", "id": 215}, {"review": "I love these strings, they never stop amazing me! ... wether you use them for electric or acoustic they always work well, clean bright tones and heavy riff giving, these strings last and work well.. I've never tried another type of strings and I don't think I will", "id": 238}, {"review": "I gave it a 5 star because monster cables come with a life time warranty depending on how it breaks, but this 6ft cord is taller than i am which means it's about 6' 2&#34; tall... it's a great product for the money exspecially if it's just being used for a late night practice with a small amp or for a pedal connection into your amp, it's short and sturdy enough to take the roughest beatings and still keep working", "id": 241}, {"review": "I gave this a 5 star for the simple fact that this tremolo has a bigger block for more sustain and a better all around intonation on any cheaply made guitar, I replaced this with the one that came on my squier affinity strat and let me just say the sustain and over all tone has been shaped on my guitar, it now stays in better tune and sounds amazing, I did also replace the tuners on my chinese made squier as well so that also helps with this tone, sustain and intonation and playing ability of the guitar", "id": 677}, {"review": "I've always loved the ernie ball straps from playing it all the way down to your knees, all the way up to you chest the strap never fails, I've owned countless ernie ball straps and I always come back to them for the main reason, I've never had one fail! a great strap for a great price", "id": 74}, {"review": "for the price you can't really beat this little amp, the only down fall is that at full volume with the gain up, the little speaker gets kinda muddy, but for a bright clean tone it works well, the tone controle offers a well rounded array of tones and the gain is great from a blues to metal tone of gain.the headphones input just is handy when wanting to play into the wee hours of the morning without disturbing anybody, but with the headphones hooked up you can really hear the digital sound it makes... but for the money it's a great buy", "id": 235}]
