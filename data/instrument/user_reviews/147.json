[{"review": "What can I say, they are Ernie Ball Slinky strings. I've been using Slinkys on my acoustics and electrics for 40 years and they have never let me down- (Unlike some of the higher priced strings) I might add. Very responsive and never dull or weak sounding. Crisp highs and smooth lows that don't get &#34;mudded&#34; out. I would recommend these to anyone to at least try a set on your acoustic guitar and Ernie Ball Super Slinkys on your electric guitar. Still, after all of these years and innovations in strings, Ernie Ball still gets my vote hands down!!", "id": 85}, {"review": "Right out of the box this guitar was flawless. I played it with the strings it came with (to inspect intonation-fret buzz etc. the old strings would work for set-up if needed) and the intonation (harmonics at the 12 fret exactly matched the fretted note at the 12th fret) was dead on. Absolutely no fret buzz even at the 21st fret. I have been playing guitar for 40 years and I have seen my fair share of acoustic guitars in that time. To say this is a beautiful playing and sounding instrument just doesn't do it justice. I have played many expensive acoustic guitars that didn't sound or play as well as this even after set-up. The lows are nice and clear and the highs are clear without sounding \"tinny\" or banjo like. A very well built, great sounding guitar. For the price you can't go wrong. I would recommend this guitar to novices and pros. I was not expecting a guitar of this quality for such a low price. 100% satisfied. Rock on Jasmine!!", "id": 183}, {"review": "Great cable for patching in and rocking out. It is also low noise and very suitable for recording as well. 100% Recommend to anyone looking for a good quality (without an over the top price) cable!!", "id": 241}, {"review": "For the most part, this is a well built/durable gig bag. I only rated it at 3 stars for the lack of padding. If you need a protective cover for your guitar then this gig bag is for you. If you want something to protect your guitar from bumps and bangs get a more expensive gig bag with more padding or spend the cash on a good hard case. Remember, you get what you pay for and this is a perfect example of that.", "id": 539}, {"review": "The tabs broke off right out of the package (the other reviews made me aware this may happen). An easy fix with some Super Glue and for the price, who cares if I have to fix it. It is 100% accurate and very easy to use. Other than the tabs breaking it is a great little tuner for the money. Highly Recommend!!", "id": 706}, {"review": "I was apprehensive about ordering this pickup but am so glad I did!! I am now able to play/ record my acoustic through my effects processor and play it through my amplifiers. Does an awesome job of reproducing your acoustics sound. I recommend this to anyone looking to amplify the sound of their acoustic guitar!!", "id": 789}]
