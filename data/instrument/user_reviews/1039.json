[{"review": "I've written a review before. They are excellent. Never broke a string, but I only play at home as a hobby. therefore they not abused.", "id": 103}, {"review": "Compared these all in Medium .013's on a Taylor 210 dreadnought .... Martin SP Bronze & Phosphor Bronze, Martins Lifespan SP, Dr, D'addario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze, and Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze and Phospher Bronze. I tried them back to back. Switching back and forth. Narrowing it down to D'addario and Elixirs. I did the same with these 3 sets. One day I'd try all 3 playing along with a cd. Then I'd try a different set every 3 days. The Elixir 80/20 comes out on top. Best sounding of all, smooth on my fingers. Second, Elixir Phospher bronze, last was D'addario. I'd be satisfied with the D'addario they do sound good. But the Elixir sounds & feels better.", "id": 104}, {"review": "I've been using these for years. Tried others but I prefer these. I'd allways come back to D'addario's. They just sound good. I'm satisfied.", "id": 156}, {"review": "These strings are my second choice after the Elixir 80/20 Bronze. They are warmer sounding, well balanced. Cost a lot but well worth it to me.", "id": 297}, {"review": "Not as good as the headstock tuner I purchased. I used it a few times. It can be used as tuner or a pickup for my acoustic.  I wouldn't buy another one.", "id": 474}, {"review": "This little tuner is excellent. Very accurate. I love it. I have other tuners but this one is the best. I didn't realize it was so small. I was concerned when I first open the package because of it's size. But this mini tuner is just plain amazing. I'm glad I bought it.", "id": 785}, {"review": "I like it. This is a good pedal for end of line tone adjustments. Like all other pedals, it's not \"The Pedal\" (seems like you always need another one). But it does add to the other pedals in shaping your tone. After you've settle on a setting you like, it adds a subtle, but noticeable addition to your sound.", "id": 300}]
