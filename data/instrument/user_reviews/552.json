[{"review": "This is a great product, just not for me. I found it brightened my tone way too much and I went back to plastic. Gave my guitar a bad metallic sound, and I lost bottom end.", "id": 415}, {"review": "Very big, very cushioned. I didn't notice that it helped all that much with the weight of my bass, but helped a little. Almost thought it was a little too cumbersome, kind of bit into my neck a little.", "id": 452}, {"review": "I went with this over road runner because of the pouch designs which i like better because they are square. Unfortunately I think the Roadrunner is better quality, thicker material.", "id": 469}, {"review": "I have been playing for 17 years and have seen alot of patch cables. These are great quality and for the price you cant go wrong. These are currently the only cables I use on my pedalboard. Short of monster or mogami, these are the best you can get for the money.", "id": 578}, {"review": "I liked the strap, used it for many years and it held up great. The texture almost looks fake though.", "id": 253}, {"review": "I prefer this design that is fitted to hold the exact size of a diatonic compared to the style that is made to fit any size. Great quality, lasts forever. You won't be dissapointed.", "id": 354}]
