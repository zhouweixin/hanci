[{"review": "This is everything you need in a record brush.  The bristles are the perfect quality and softness to get all the dust that sits between the lines of the record. Highly recommended!", "id": 260}, {"review": "This is a great xlr cable and does the job for what I need it to, which is attach my dslr shoe to an external shotgun mic.  It has low noise, clean sound/good transmission.  The only issue is that this particular cable, more-so than any of my other ones, is hard to get a locking click on anything it attaches to on either end.  Once it's attached it's fine, but then it's the same coming off, I have to pull much harder than with my other cables and it makes me worried I'll damage a microphone.  With expensive equipment, I'd use a different cable as the tight grip on both the male and female sides worries me.", "id": 554}, {"review": "I have used these pads on numerous non-Shure headphones like the fostex trp50 and the hifiman he-500 and I have to say that these are by far the best , most inexpensive solution to any headphone they will fit.  They ave made the sound quality better on each headset that I have put them on, and they are softer and more comfortable than any other replacement pads I have tried in the price range,  Highly recommended!", "id": 646}, {"review": "Much better than similarly priced products out there for tuning.  I can't recommend this enough and the battery last a LONG time!  I haven't had to change mine in almost two years since I've had it!  Just a great overall tuner.", "id": 707}, {"review": "I haven't had to change the battery on this bad boy in over two years since I've had it!  It also is bright and is very accurate.  If looking for an inexpensive tuner look no further!", "id": 706}]
