[{"review": "Sturdy, well-designed and frets the strings well.  Ships quickly.  The back clamps firmly to the guitar without maring the finish. Great value.", "id": 116}, {"review": "Well-conceived, spring loaded slot holes multiple picks.  It is small and can be affixed (self-adhering) to the guitar near the bridge so you always have picks handy when you are ready to play.  Inexpensive solution and quite handy.", "id": 233}, {"review": "Well executed black guitar strap.  It is made of strong, seatbelt-like material with excellent stitching that is unlikely to ever fray or come apart.  The length adjusts easily to accomodate tall adults or children.  It has excellent leather ends with slots cut into the leather to put over you guitar buttons (not-included).  Nothing fancy but great quality that gets the job done inexpensively.", "id": 285}, {"review": "Excellent guitar picks of medium hardness.  Picks come in multiple colors that fit your fingers perfectly.  If you are a beginner or just play infrequently why pay more?", "id": 574}, {"review": "Small yet sturdy enough to hold a full-size guitar.  Nothing to put together, just spread the legs and place your guitar on the two holding arms.  A very good price for an excellent product.", "id": 601}]
