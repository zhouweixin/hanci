[{"review": "Planet Waves humidifiers are simple to use and a great product to guard against drying your guitar and causing splitting. Dampen the sponge, squeeze out excess water, insert the sponge into the holder and the holder between hte strings. Check on it every few days and keep the sponge damp. Couldn't be any easier. I use them all winter long in my guitars.", "id": 71}, {"review": "THis device is ok. It is light weight and folds nicely, but it is not especially stable. Convenient storage is its biggest plus.", "id": 163}, {"review": "I have been using Hercos for for many years. They are simple to use and offer my banjos good humidification.  I place a Herco in the neck section of the case and another in the section where the head sits.For guitars I place a Herco near the peg head and a stringed instrument humidifier that slips between the strings in the other. Great insurance against damage to instruments owing to dryness.", "id": 314}, {"review": "THis snap strap quick release system is a boon for those of us without a send strap button on our ukes sand guitars. Very serviceable, easy to use, sturdy.", "id": 174}, {"review": "This is a very serviceable strap at a great price.
