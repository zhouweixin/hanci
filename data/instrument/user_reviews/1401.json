[{"review": "I&#8217;ve used strap locks before and never found any to be easy to attach or remove but these are well made and easy to use. Very secure. The best I&#8217;ve used so far.", "id": 44}, {"review": "I&#8217;m not sure exactly how to rate these picks except to say they&#8217;re what they are. Guitar picks. However, the price was good.", "id": 120}, {"review": "Great strings and they seem to hold their sound a long while. I&#8217;m not sure why a few people are putting these strings down; I&#8217;ve used them numerous times without any issues. They last as long and sound as good as any other brands I&#8217;ve played.", "id": 156}, {"review": "I read some mixed reviews about the unit but I&#8217;ve not noticed anything abnormal with mine. Seems to do an accurate job and really cheap price.", "id": 811}, {"review": "These straps are very good at a low cost. I actually like them better than a few high-priced straps I have and they&#8217;re lightweight as well.", "id": 285}]
