[{"review": "If you haven't used these picks, get some. They are the perfect size and shape. Your really can't beat them.", "id": 117}, {"review": "I like the sound of this amp. As has been said in other reviews if you want clean sound it isn't the loudest in the world, but is loud enough for practice. If you want a little distortion, turn the gain up and you can have plenty of volume. I'm using it with a cheapo guitar from the sixties, (a Decca), and I believe it produces the best sound I have ever gotten out of it.", "id": 391}, {"review": "I had been tuning my guitar by ear and thought I was doing a good job. After I used the Snark my guitar sounds so much better. I will never be without one again. The snark is easy to use and shows you positively when the guitar is in tune.", "id": 706}, {"review": "Hangs my guitar around my neck so I don't have to hold it there. Easily adjusted. Looks nice. The pick pocket is handy.", "id": 285}, {"review": "I have bought three of these. I managed to break one of them where the cradle attaches to the stand. The connection could be stronger, but it was my fault that I broke it. They do a good job of holding my guitars and they look nice.", "id": 519}, {"review": "I plugged it in the outlet. Plugged it into my Fender Mini Tone-master Amp. I don't need to worry about batteries any more.", "id": 521}]
