[{"review": "i've had these straplocks for a few years now and they haven't failed me once! i love them, and i never have to worry about my guitars getting damaged from a strap falling off or so. they rotate in full circles, and are super durable. you should buy them for all your guitars, and you'll never have to worry again. they are also very easy to use, and &#34;install&#34;.", "id": 44}, {"review": "thankfully i still have most of these picks. i'm always losing them, but they work super well and i will always buy this brand from now on.", "id": 61}, {"review": "i've had this strap for at least a year now, and it still works so well. goes great with my guitar too!", "id": 74}, {"review": "i love the design, and the strap holds up very well. i would reccomend to anyone who likes gibson or the lightning bolt symbol.", "id": 79}, {"review": "great strings, and they last well! i've never had a problem with these and i'm glad i can get them on here for a decent price.", "id": 156}, {"review": "these strings are great with my acoustics-however, lately i've been using electric strings instead. they work well, sound great, and i believe they really compliment my playing.", "id": 198}, {"review": "i love this tuner so much! the only reason that i had to buy it a second time was because i lost my first one unfortunately at a music camp a few years back. it works so well though, and i knew i'd have to buy a second one since i'd never see the first one again.", "id": 706}, {"review": "although the quality is obviously not that of a studio, this guy serves it's purpose and i am not dissapointed in buying it. i use it when i mess around in garageband, and it does a very good job for not being an expensive peice of equipment. it's also very easy to use, and the USB cord is super easy for using witha laptop or computer. plus, you canplug your headphones in and listen which is always a plus.", "id": 639}]
