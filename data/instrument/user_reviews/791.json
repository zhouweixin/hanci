[{"review": "I like Fender Mediums, always have, but, I gotta branch out man.  Not sure about these picks yet.  The feel a little more stiff my usual.  I want them to last longer.  What happened to the days when you carried the same pick around in your pocket for months and played it until it was round?", "id": 69}, {"review": "I use mediums but bought these for my nephews Takamine and they sound awesome on that guitar.  Always love these strings.  This kid has not changed his strings in years so I thought I would give hem the best chance of keeping his guitar sounding good for as long as possible.", "id": 103}, {"review": "Always the best string I buy.  I like the Martin coated as well but I prefer the elixer.  This is the first set I baught for my electrics but so far so good.", "id": 106}, {"review": "Kind of cheap and digs into the neck a bit but I only use it for walking around the house strumming when I am playing my secondary guitars.  It's fine for the price.", "id": 208}, {"review": "Got what I paid for.  Worth the money, definitely.  Sturdy and stable and I need more words so I can ...done", "id": 258}, {"review": "Very accurate. When I wanted a G I got a G.  I have such a refined ear, that I only have this around if I have a head cold, or you know, don't want to show off, but it's a good tuner.", "id": 595}, {"review": "Capos ruin frets but i find them to be necessary.  This one has a very strong spring so I am hoping i lossens up with use.", "id": 603}, {"review": "Great great great great great great great great great.  Been uning them for years.  Love the sound and playability and durability.  matin coated are good too.", "id": 104}]
