[{"review": "Running 4 mics, samples and the odd phone call into one device for recording was a bit daunting.  This mixer handles it all perfectly.  I'm literally knew nothing about it when it arrived (first time I'd ever seen a mixer of any kind) in terms of usage but managed to figure it out quickly, get hiss free, nicely panned, beautifully warm sounds that have helped make my podcasting sound wonderful, professional and frankly better than I could have imagined.  I didn't need the 'FX' .. but the the other was out of stock :D I'll get to them one day.I wish it had a power button.", "id": 369}, {"review": "Podcasting on a bit of a budget ($200 setup), I wanted good sound quality, nice warm tones .... these mics deliver in a world where I didn't quite have the cash for condensers I wanted.  I needed four mics and this was the best cheap option and my word, these sound great.  3 for under $40 was fantastic.  I am glad I didn't break budget here.  I'm using these with the Behringer 1202FX mixer.  I am so extremely happy with them.", "id": 405}, {"review": "I'm using four of these for Podcasting - they seem just a tiny bit flimsy but for my purposes where they will be gently used I am completely happy.", "id": 465}, {"review": "There is not much you can say about these other than they fit my Behringer ULTRAVOICE XM1800S just fine.  I don't sound to muffled with them on either - the colors made my Podcasting team bicker over who was getting which one.  I won't hold it against these Windscreens.", "id": 806}, {"review": "One of the big selling points for this unit was the sound quality and the need for no drivers.  Well - after starting to use it on Windows 7 x64 I was dismayed to find simply awful electrical interference and buzz in recordings.  I went to the Behringer website, I found the product page, found a tab for drivers, downloaded them and boom .... all my problems were solved but that had taken me days and days.  Needless to say that portion of the marketing is crap - drivers are absolutely required if you use Windows 7.  I am using this with a Behringer 1202FX mixer - it is a good combo.  The build quality is nothing to shout about but even though the enclosure is plastic if feels sturdy enough.  I treat my gear with care - I figure it'll probably last for years and years and years.  I am extremely happy, and hopeful that somebody will read this review and skip to the drivers immediately upon installation.", "id": 384}]
