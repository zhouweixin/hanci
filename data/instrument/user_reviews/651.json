[{"review": "I am a bass player so I like my picks to be a bit thicker and wider. I tend to Play with Fender 346 so I was pleasantly surprised when I found that this pick worked really well for me.", "id": 62}, {"review": "I wish I bought longer cables but these cables are fine. They do what they are supposed to do but I know I can spend a few more dollar dollar bills and get a higher quality cable but the tonal difference wouldn't be anything significant.", "id": 181}, {"review": "I have been trying to find a good vibrato pedal for a long time. I have bought $150 pedals and $100 pedals and I got this one for $25 and it blows all the others out of the water. The only down side to this pedal is that you either need to run it off a 9volt or the Behringer power supply. I couldn't get it to work properly with my pedalboard power or my Pyle-Pro PPDLP02 DC supply. The plastic case feels like it may break at anytime but aside from that I love this pedal more than a puppy playing a harp in the middle of a daisy field in Michigan.", "id": 429}, {"review": "Works fine. It is of course difficult to tune when other's are playing around you. I found the mic tuner isn't as accurate. Also the rubber pad on the clamp falls off easily. It is better than most other clip on tuners though and the battery lasts longer too.", "id": 707}, {"review": "Cheap. The best way to describe this stand. It serves it's purpose but spend a few shekels more on a better guitar stand.", "id": 883}, {"review": "I' don't get any hum and it powers what I need it to. A much cheaper route than a DC Brick or a Pedal Power.", "id": 428}]
