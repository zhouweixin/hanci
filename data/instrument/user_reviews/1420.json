[{"review": "I am so happy with this product that after buying the first one, I bought two more for my bouzouki and for my octave mandolin.", "id": 189}, {"review": "Very good stand especially for the price. It is not incredibly stable, but it is enough stable unless your microphone is super heavy.", "id": 279}, {"review": "I could not expect a better violin stand. It is very robust, versatile, good looking and not very expensive. Highly recommended.", "id": 290}, {"review": "Quality is really outstanding for the price. Sound is clear and crisp. I get a lot of feedback, but I guess that it is not because of the microphone.", "id": 594}, {"review": "Good for the price, but  If you can spend a few dollars more, I would recommend the graph tech ones.", "id": 817}]
