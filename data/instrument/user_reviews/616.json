[{"review": "Slips right under the guitar strings and does not impede your guitar playing in any way. A very good design.", "id": 174}, {"review": "Assembled the stand in seconds. It is very stable and solidly constructed. Should last a life-time. Very, very good value.", "id": 604}, {"review": "Adjustments are easy to make and the fit/feel is fine. No fancy designs, but a great value for the price.", "id": 656}, {"review": "Simple to deploy and holds the guitar very effectively. Good value. Low to the ground, so balance is not an issue.", "id": 883}, {"review": "A great little package for the price, but unfortunately, the zipper failed the first time I tried zipping it up. I have a standard size acoustic guitar, but be aware, the fit was snug, but not tight.", "id": 865}]
