My hands sweat a lot so I really need the grip.", "id": 64}, {"review": "The best strings I ever bought and I've bought them all. I got these for my electric and the EJ26-10P acoustic electric for my acoustic. They have a really full sound, bright highs, and they bend like crazy.", "id": 156}, {"review": "These are the best strings I've ever put on my guitar, I play a really nice Morgan Monroe Creekside and these strings give it the fullness it deserves. The bright highs, the rich mids, and they bend like crazy when I need them too", "id": 198}, {"review": "This will b my 2nd one of these so to me it's worth it. The 1st one I loaned to a friend and never got back so for $10 I just got another. I think their pretty accurate. I normally tune by ear but if there's a few of us playing then sometimes someone needs one, and I always use it putting on new strings myself. As far as battery life goes you can get them right on Amazon. They are cheap you can get a package of 6, each one lasting over a year or if you prefer you can go over to Walmart and get them in the jewelery section.", "id": 762}, {"review": "I thought something was drastically wrong with my guitar but it was these strings, they buzzed and move so much they hit every metal on every fret.", "id": 205}]
