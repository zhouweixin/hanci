[{"review": "I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables, and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g., running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell, and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them, and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies, so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.They're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all.", "id": 16}, {"review": "They're very thin nylon picks. They're good for practicing the hand motions of strumming; they put up very little resistance, so they train you to keep your hand stable. I still sometimes play with them since they give a really nice bright tone, but I usually want something thicker in order to be able to flatpick melody lines in between strums. I also sometimes use them when practicing flatpicking, since flatpicking with a really thin pick reveals things about your body mechanics that you don't notice with a thicker pick.They're great for what they are (thin, flexible picks), and Amazon has the best price.", "id": 62}, {"review": "First time I ordered these was in a larger order, and Amazon forgot to put them in the box. Oops! I contacted their customer support people and they overnighted me a replacement set of strings at no extra charge. Thank you, Amazon!I like the tone of D'Addario's 80/20 bronze strings. I've been playing more bluegrass-y guitar lately, so I've switched to mostly using phosphor bronze, but these strings have a great warmth that I really enjoy. I also notice that electronic tuners have a much easier time picking up the notes from the 80/20 strings.Amazon has the best price on these, and they're inexpensive enough that I can afford to change strings whenever I feel like it. I like their tone, and they react well with my skin chemistry so they last a long time.", "id": 199}, {"review": "What a nice strap! It's a really beautiful deep brown color that really harmonizes with the reddish mahogany back and sides of my dreadnought.The whole strap is leather--no adjustment hardware to scratch your instrument. It took me a little while to get used to this method, but now I don't even think of it. The main strap has several slots cut into it, and there's another piece that threads through the slots and then doubles back over itself to lock into place. It's simple and very secure. It makes adjusting the strap length a bit of a pain, but how often do you adjust your strap length once you've gotten it set? I almost never do.It's an affordable strap that looks elegant, is wide enough to be comfortable with an acoustic guitar, has great length adjustment range, and rolls up to fit in the case. I had to slightly enlarge one of the holes in order to make it fit the strapjack for my guitar--I have a pickup system installed, and the end button is a bit bigger than a standard strap button. Ten seconds with a sharp knife and my strap now fits perfectly. I would buy it again.", "id": 481}, {"review": "I bought this because my band's primary PA mixer doesn't have high-impedance inputs for a guitar pickup, and I don't always want to bring my submixer for quick-change gigs. So, a small, cheap DI box seemed like a good solution.The PDC21 is a no-frills device. It converts a 1/4\" instrument cable (high Z) to a balanced/unbalanced 1/4\" or XLR (low Z) signal. It does a fine job. I don't notice it coloring the sound (i.e., it's not changing the balance of frequencies transmitted) although it does lower the volume somewhat. That's to be expected in a passive DI box, and it doesn't bother me.I'm using it with an LR Baggs M1A active soundhole pickup. The M1A spits out a fairly hot signal, and I don't have any problem with the signal loss associated with the PDC21. If I were using a passive pickup in my guitar, the results might be different.Bottom line: it's small, fairly light, seems durable, and it does a good job converting my active guitar signal to the XLR inputs our PA mixer requires. It does everything I wanted, and the price was right. I see no reason to go shopping for a more expensive one.", "id": 606}]
