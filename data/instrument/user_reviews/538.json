[{"review": "These strap locks were easy to install and use right off the bat. You may have to drill deeper holes into your guitar in order to use them. Just follow the instructions and you can easily attach and detach your strap whenever you feel like it.", "id": 44}, {"review": "This cloth works well in cleaning off the dust, fingerprints, oil, and dirt off of my guitar. It is thicker and bigger than the ones used with glasses cleaning so I'm sure it can be used to wipe down other things as well.", "id": 184}, {"review": "This strap feels pretty good and feels like it would be more durable than the cheaper stuff. The only issue I have with it is that the ends are not the same size so I could not install my Dunlop Straploks for it. It may just have been the one I got though.", "id": 479}, {"review": "It's a pretty great sampler to get a feel for the types of picks that you may like. I also prefer the feel of these over the plain plastic ones but thats just me.", "id": 744}, {"review": "This is a great and inexpensive tuner that is easy to use. It's easy to setup out of the box and can tune via vibration or microphone. It's easy to figure out if the strings are in pitch or not. The only downside is that it feels a bit flimsy sometimes.", "id": 707}]
