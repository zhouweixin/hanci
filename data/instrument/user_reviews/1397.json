[{"review": "This was very easy to put together! Top just slips on the folding bottom part of stand and is very adjustable. Love it!", "id": 155}, {"review": "This stand is very stable and easy to put together. Works perfect for keeping my guitar safe from being knocked over.", "id": 258}, {"review": "Love that I didn't have to assemble this stand!  Just had to unfold it. Was easy to adjust and is very stable. It's nice to be able to sit down at keyboard without having to worry about bumping it. Also seat fits perfectly under it when not in use.", "id": 358}, {"review": "This is a very stable, comfortable seat.  The legs are easily removable for storage. Love that it is rated for higher weights so I don't have to worry about it collapsing.", "id": 362}, {"review": "This strap is very comfortable! Love how it just velcros right over my strap without having to remove it from guitar. It does slide around some and has to be adjusted every time I put it on but is so worth the final result.", "id": 452}, {"review": "This arrived a week sooner then expected!  I am very happy with this bag, my Fender LH San Miguel Acoustic guitar fits perfectly!  It is nicely padded and has lots of pockets for anything you might need to carry.", "id": 469}, {"review": "Very handy to have.  Could peel paper off bottom and stick to guitar (or something) to keep your picks close at hand.  I haven't done that myself as I don't want to mess up the finish of my guitar but could see it being handy. Picks fit snug but slide out easily when needed.", "id": 167}]
