[{"review": "I love this pedal. It gives just the right amount of crunch when needed. Typical Behringer pedal with plastic case but a really good sound. I use this in my home studio so durability is not a concern. Nice and quiet when not in use and can scream when you need it to. Highly recommended.", "id": 381}, {"review": "This is a very nice way to get rid of all those wall warts and batteries for your pedals. Easily powers my 6 pedals and adds no noise to the signal path. Simple, effective,works as advertised. The extra adapters are a nice touch. Get one, you'll be happy you did.", "id": 428}, {"review": "First Behringer pedal I have returned. Almost no effect provided by pedal. I have returned the unit. Not worth it. Lousy pedal.", "id": 487}, {"review": "this is a nice little pedal. It effectively quiets all my other pedals. Works as advertised. Not much else to say. Get one!", "id": 615}, {"review": "I've been trying to get a specific sound for quite a while now. This pedal completed that task. It's hard to describe the sound that this pedal provides but it is perfect. Very punchy and crisp. You can't go wrong with Behringer pedals. They are plastic though, so they might not hold up under heavy road use, but for home studios they are perfect. Highly recommended.", "id": 645}]
