[{"review": "I'm just starting out on the electric guitar and was told these were the best.  I like the light strings because they are kinder to my fingers and they still have a decent sound.  The price is right.", "id": 156}, {"review": "I love these strings because the sounds are so pure and not twangy, and they are pretty easy to use.  Each string is labeled so you know which goes where.  I'm a beginner and can change my own strings, so I'm proud of myself.", "id": 255}, {"review": "So easy to use.  Just clip it on and ta-da!  The screen is very easy to see and tuning my banjo is a breeze with it.  Unfortunately, my dog thought it was a delicious toy and mauled it beyond recognition so I need to buy another one.  If your dog loves toys, keep this out of reach.", "id": 707}, {"review": "When I got this I thought it was a cheap toy-like thing, but when I put it on my banjo, it perched on the head and was practically invisible to anybody else, but easy to see when I needed it.  It's red when out of tune and green when in tune.  It does have small lines to tell you you are close to being tuned.  I love it when I am the only one using it.  Unlike the clamp kind, like the Snark, it's hard to share.  The clamp seems flimsy and ratchets open and closed and takes a little getting used to, so between my husband and me using it, I'm afraid the thing will break.  I play the banjo and it fits nicely on the head, but my husband has to find a place at the end of his acoustical guitar for it.", "id": 785}, {"review": "My husband got these and they don't get dirty as quickly, which is a plus.  Initially the sounds aren't as clear as the uncoated ones, but it wears off after a couple of hours of play and you wouldn't know the difference.  He'll buy them again.  No difference in putting the new strings on from the regular kind.", "id": 109}]
