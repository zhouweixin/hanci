Stout, stable, and even looks good. It's holding a Gibson Les Paul, so it has to be trustworthy! Great price. Wayne", "id": 519}, {"review": "Rugged, good looking, efficient...sorta like me. Have several tuners of different names and quality. But this Seiko is certainly the quickest. The rubber housing is an excellent idea. Would buy another.", "id": 532}]
