No off/on power switch though but small consideration when you think about what it can do.  Connect mics, iPods, MP3 players...and control sound and volume, at your fingertips!", "id": 368}, {"review": "Excellent equipment!  For the price I paid, can't beat what I got.  Have used all three and had exactly zero problems with them.  It's been several years now, and this is a name that will move forward in sound equipment.", "id": 405}, {"review": "Got this because I thought the length would be enough.  It was, but I wanted more mobility so went to the longer length.  Had no problems with this cable though.  Works great!", "id": 556}, {"review": "The extra length gives me more flexibility and maneuverability.  Cord works well and hasn't been any problem, to date.  Plugs directly to the system, or my mini-amp.  Works well.", "id": 21}]
