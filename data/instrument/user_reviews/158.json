I dont go any lighter than the yellow picks sometimes i use the green which are a little thicker.", "id": 455}, {"review": "Comes unassembled but is a no brainer to connect the 2 pieces to the frame. works well more stable than my 14 dollar stand.", "id": 519}, {"review": "Tunes by sound or vibration thats all i use it for the vibration mode is really nice. buy one its convenient", "id": 707}, {"review": "It was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china.  Any thing i have bought that was shipped directly from china has been much lower quality than anything retailers are even willing to sell.  If you can wait a month for delivery or longer, if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up.  If you have over a $500 guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too. I have decided to build my own", "id": 779}]
