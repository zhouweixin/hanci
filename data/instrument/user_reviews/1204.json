When used correctly though, it does it's job just fine.", "id": 25}, {"review": "These kind of clips can break.

He barely ever uses it, but the times it's been plugged in, it puts out pretty good sound for the price.", "id": 564}, {"review": "For the money, I doubt you can beat these microphones. I just needed something for occasional outdoor shows and didn't want to spend a ton of money. So far, so good.
