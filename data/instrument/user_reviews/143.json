[{"review": "All these harmonicas in one case and they sound great. You have to get use to the plastic but it is very easy to do and once you do get ready to play away. Nice tone and fun.", "id": 293}, {"review": "I use this with a Behringer mixer and run it through my laptop computer to record my music. It was just what I needed to give me clean sound. Running it through the USB not only give great flexibility but also makes my recordings sound like I was in a studio. I highly recommend it.", "id": 384}, {"review": "I have a home studio and needed extra cables for my three guitars and keyboard. I wanted to have them all plugged in and ready to go without having to switch cables all the time. So, I tried this cable and it works perfectly. Very heavy cord and top quality construction. Can't beat the price either. Will buy again.", "id": 512}, {"review": "Not only are these great picks to look at they are great picks to use. I love the picks, the tin they come in and the ease of use.", "id": 669}, {"review": "Great value! Using it as a back up stage mic. Sound very good and for the price it can't be beat. It does not quite come up to the standard of our professional mics, but gets the job done when needed.", "id": 690}, {"review": "I cold not believe how much more sturdy my guitar is in this stand. I had the typical guitar stand before and had to be very careful about it tipping over. This one is so secure and my guitar has never felt like it would tip over. Small and sturdy. I use it at practice and during our live shows. You can't go wrong with this.", "id": 883}]
