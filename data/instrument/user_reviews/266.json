[{"review": "It's a great string winder, and it is so nice being able to wind and cut the string with the same tool. It's a brilliant idea haha. It's very good quality, like all planet waves products.", "id": 94}, {"review": "As with any Daddario or planet waves product, it's always great quality and has great tone. I've used almost every brand of stings out there, but I always come back to Daddario.", "id": 156}, {"review": "It's made by monster cable. Need I say more? Of course it's a great cable, and being able to change the rubber band on the ends is nice to identify which cable is which.", "id": 241}, {"review": "Great quality casters for the money! Just as good or better quality than the ones that come stock on most amps. You can't go wrong with these.", "id": 542}, {"review": "This mic is good considering the price. Does it sound exactly like a 57? No. Do it have a decent quality sound? Absolutely. If you're expecting an SM57, then buy an SM57. If you want something close, on. A budget, this is your mic. Great value and good sound.", "id": 777}, {"review": "What can I say? It's a mic cable haha. It's a great cable for the price. It sounds good, and seems to be very durable. It's not a monster cable, but considering its 1/5 of the price, I can't complain.", "id": 465}, {"review": "This is a great value! I was able to record some very good quality guitar tracks using this. It doesn't sound exactly like an sm57, but it will get you close. You can EG your amp to compensate for the difference.", "id": 594}]
