[{"review": "Very well made.  No problems.  Should be able to stand up to any use or abuse.", "id": 127}, {"review": "This seems like a nice product, but maybe I'm doing something wrong.  I can't get the bottom guitar support to lock in place.  It twists around and that makes it a little hard to put the guitar in place.  Maybe there is something I need to do differently?", "id": 310}, {"review": "Great amp but the instructions are minimal and pretty worthless.  Unless you have a mixer, you can only use one instrument and one microphone with this.  Really puts out the sound though, and I guess that's what you get an amp for!  I used it in a basketball gym and only had to turn the gain up to 2-3 to fill the place.  Very nice effects on both channels.", "id": 389}, {"review": "Amazingly sturdy for the $.  It isn't as sturdy as some, but it probably is the sturdiest of the truly collapsible stands.  It folds up very nicely.  I'd buy it again.", "id": 230}, {"review": "It's really not a 200w system.  The booklet even says it is only 100 watts, and I doubt it is really even that powerful.  The wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it.  My Shure XLR wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug.  The instrument input works OK with my Taylor guitar, but it's not 100 watts loud.  I guess it's OK as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals.", "id": 325}]
