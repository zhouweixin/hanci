[{"review": "These are great guitar strings and are all that guitarists say they are. They are so tuneful, they make an ordinary acoustic guitar sound beautiful. My only concern is that if the strings aren't wound properly they seem brittle and break. e.g. Low E and A strings and the vulnerable G string.The LIGHT version I find, are particularly suited to finger picking.", "id": 103}, {"review": "These are perfect. Hard to beat strings. They last, keep in tune, and keep their tone. They don't need any string cleaners either. So you can save money on that. An obvious noticeable difference between the Medium gauge and the Light is that these Medium gauge are not recommended if you like to finger-pick a lot.  But boy.... Are they bright! Enough to blow the spruce tops from pine trees!", "id": 104}, {"review": "If you just want a basic guitar stand to keep your guitar safe whilst at home. This is it. Have not gigged with it as yet. So no comments as to its toughness. Great value though.", "id": 258}, {"review": "These strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter Bronze Nanoweb. Still a great guitar string. A real winner for Elixir who are the originators of &#34;Goretex&#34; A real triumph of re-invention. Well done Goretex!", "id": 295}, {"review": "When I purchased this I'd seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar. Guess what? As far as I can tell, there is no difference whatsoever between this saddle and the original the guitar came with. This is NOT worth the money.", "id": 414}, {"review": "I've used these for years....acoustic and electric. Very hard to beat. I like the feel and texture of these &#34;pics&#34;. They do the job brilliantly.", "id": 680}, {"review": "A good piece of kit. Except it does have problems removing occasional sticky string pegs. It's also squeakily noisy when string winding. The cutter works perfectly.", "id": 94}]
