[{"review": "This is a tough deal to beat on a boom stand. It is very well made, and it is very adjustable so no issues sitting or standing, playing with an instument or just singing. Only thing, make sure you read the description well. It is a euro stand so it has 5/8\"-27 threads. It does not come with a mic clip. When I ordered my mic from Behringer, their clip had 3/8\" standard threads which obviously would not attach. I ordered a univeral clip so that drove the cost up some. Now if the manufacture would just provide a clip, they would have the best stand deal going. Overall, I would buy again!", "id": 279}, {"review": "Does a great job of checking cords. Was able to eliminate a lot of bad cords from my stash. Tests multiple types of cords also!", "id": 318}, {"review": "The fact that it is passive really kills it. I just could not get any sound out of it, I tried multiple placements. I finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it. Not worth the money, or the extra hole in your guitar.", "id": 611}, {"review": "There really does not need to be a 10 page review that breaks this thing down to every tedious detail. This is a tuner that clips on the headstock of the guitar, and tunes it in perfect pitch. For a 10 dollar bill it is impossible to beat. These are a staple on every single guitar in our band! Bright and easy to read!", "id": 707}, {"review": "Not the greatest cord I have ever used, not the worst either. I would prefer Fender Tweed cables over this one if I had to make a recommendation.", "id": 168}, {"review": "I use these in my studio for the two amps and the bass drum. These are heavy duty and well made. Really reasonably priced. I love em!", "id": 224}, {"review": "Works as advertised. Great at eliminating feedback in a live setting. Also great for just muffling the sound for playing around the house quietly.", "id": 497}]
