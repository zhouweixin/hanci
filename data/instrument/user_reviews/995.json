[{"review": "Works as advertised for my purpose. It is in front of a computer speaker set (with woofer) for use on a Vizio TV as a sound system.Works fine. I have other Behringer gear and it always works.", "id": 363}, {"review": "These replaced the ETB92 nylon tapewounds I tried. I didn't realize how much low end I was missing until I put these on. Very nice.", "id": 407}, {"review": "It's well made. Not much else you can say about it. Buy it. It is worth it. Packaged very well.", "id": 662}, {"review": "These worked fine. The mistake I made was buying them hastily. I needed nylon core strings..not steel. My mistake. I loaded them up anyway....sounded great.", "id": 225}, {"review": "It works but shut it down as soon as you are finished tuning up. It eats batteries like nothing this size I have ever seen. The swivel ball socket broke and I had to glue the arm into the remaining socket. Hmmm.", "id": 706}, {"review": "My old cable was stiff and unruly. This one is not so stiff and is very well built. Buy it.", "id": 803}]
