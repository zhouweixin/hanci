[{"review": "Easy to use capo. Good strength - holds the strings down well.. Not sure that it's as good as the G7th capo, which I still find is the best for holding the strings down evenly so that they stay in tune, but the Kyser is much cheaper and does a good job.", "id": 26}, {"review": "Probably the best capo I have ever had. It's easy to put on and holds the strings well. Although you always need to check the tuning after putting any capo on a guitar, this one seems not to upset the tuning too much. I'm impressed.", "id": 266}, {"review": "Plain leather. Looks good and has the Fender logo prominent. No padding, which may be a bit of a problem if you are playing long hours. I use it on a black and white Stratocaster and am happy with it.", "id": 632}, {"review": "Works well - but be careful when swivelling the display as it can easily break one of the four tabs it clips into.", "id": 707}, {"review": "This is the third Snark tuner (the others were Snark II) I have bought. Both of the others broke where the stem joins the clock-type display (could be glued together, but irritating). This one seems to be made of different material and with a bit of luck will be more durable. Why buy this after the experience of the others? Well they are very good and easy to use tuners, and for not much money (my guitar strings cost more!). This one has a great display - full colour and easy to read. I use it on a guitar, a bass and a 12 string and it works well on all of them.", "id": 811}, {"review": "You want a Fender to sound like one, and using these strings helps with that. I have them on a MIA Telecaster and they stay in tune and have good sustain. I'm happy with them.", "id": 88}]
