[{"review": "This fog machine puts out a good amount of fog but it takes several minutes to warm up.  The fog dissipates pretty quickly and the machine has a hard time keeping up to keep the room foggy.  It's ok but not the best fog machine out there.", "id": 256}, {"review": "These cables work perfect for connecting my mixer to my amp.  Not too long, not too short.  Just what I needed.", "id": 556}, {"review": "This audio adapter works perfectly.  Why spend any more than you have to to get rich sounding audio.  I'm able to use headphones and listen to a song while a different song is playing through the main speakers.", "id": 569}, {"review": "This is a great deal for two microphone stands.  They are well constructed and are very flexible; can be used with an instrument or just as an ordinary microphone stand.  Several adjustment areas allow the perfect height/positioning.  These should last a long time as long as they're not abused.", "id": 815}, {"review": "Haven't used it yet but if it's like the other cables I have from the same company, it should work fine.", "id": 9}, {"review": "These microphones have a quality-feel to them and they all worked perfectly.  I used them with my Harbinger HA60 PA system and I was not disappointed.  They don't come with cables so be sure you have some available (xlr-xlr).  You can get a 25' cable for under $5 also here on Amazon.  Good deal all around.  Would not hesitate to purchase more of them if I need to.", "id": 405}]
