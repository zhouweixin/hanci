[{"review": "Seems to work well, though I don't know how long it's supposed to last. I have sweaty hands, and when I'm done I wipe my guitar down with this lil guy and it helps a lot to keep the strings from getting dirty or cruddy.", "id": 72}, {"review": "Got mine for under 130, and it's a great Mic.  I can use it for vocal tracks, or recording for webcasts that kind of thing, or recording studio guitar sounds etc.  Awesome mic.", "id": 82}, {"review": "So I bought this to replace the original string winder I had that doesn't have a clipper on the end, and it turned out great. The clipper is strong and works well, and the winder is the same if not better. Thank you planet waves", "id": 94}, {"review": "It's a good product, works well and does what it's meant to do.  I'm glad I bought it over the other main pop filter, as that one has bad reviews.", "id": 134}, {"review": "First time I've spent over 25 bucks for headphones.  Use for both reference with a GNX4 and guitar, and easy listening.  Very accurate and no coloration of tone that I can detect.  (semi-audiophile)A bit bass heavy but overall great headphones. very comfortable.  get hot to wear in the summer!", "id": 458}]
