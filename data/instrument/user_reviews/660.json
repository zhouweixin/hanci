[{"review": "Take some time but it was well worth it.  I've always cleaned the finger boards with rubbing alcohol then used linseed oil afterwards.  This worked great and the guitars buffed up like never before!", "id": 95}, {"review": "I didn't need anything high dollar so this was just what I needed.  Does have a cheaper feel than the other (much more expensive units I've used).", "id": 248}, {"review": "These cable are perfect!!  I've bought much more expensive cable that didn't have the quality of these.  They even had velcro (re-useable tape to hold them 2 each).", "id": 439}, {"review": "I bought this along with a Clayton \"large\" glass slide.  Well the Clayton was very thin walled and didn't even fit over my ring finger knuckle.  This slide is very thick and works great!", "id": 457}, {"review": "Nice to see something well made for a change.  Most guitar straps I see that are less than $80.00 are all cheap and that fake stuff.", "id": 612}, {"review": "I'm used to the old 70's and 80's speakers that I've had on my stereo since that time.  I read the reviews about what people said about hearing things they never had before.  I was blown away.  They are all correct, get them setup right and hear all the things your music has been missing (I listen all the time with different headphones, not the same!).  The way the music was separated so well, I swear it sounded like the vocals were coming from right in front of me and the guitars were on each side of the vocals.  I had to dig up all kinds of music to test them out.  I don't know what kind of bass people are wanting out of these but when I use them to watch movies, listen to music, etc... They have lots of punch, even when I play my guitar through them (POD HD PRO).", "id": 783}]
