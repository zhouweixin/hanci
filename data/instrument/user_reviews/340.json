[{"review": "When I first learned guitar, my buddies kept telling me I'd want a capo but I held out until just recently. The Dunlop is secure, doesn't scratch the guitar at all, and holds the strings down as it should. Instead of taking the time to adjust my tuning, I can use this to achieve the tone I want. Good item for the price.", "id": 116}, {"review": "I have my 12 string on this stand when I'm taking a break from practicing (as you know, a case is where you should store your guitars, not on a stand). It is easy to assemble. You'll pay a lot more money for stands that do the job just as well as this one. if you're gigging, I might suggest a higher priced stand, but for occasional travel and home use, this will do the trick.", "id": 310}, {"review": "I have four of these - and will continue to use this product. You'll purchase this system first, then all you need to do is get the replacement packs. For my Taylor Baby, the string spacing was a little small, but there was no problem inserting the pack in my other three guitars. Very easy to use. As a recommendation for keeping your guitar in good condition, I would also buy a humidity meter so you can keep tabs on the room where you store your instruments.", "id": 406}, {"review": "I got this to use with my 12 string. It is a huge improvement over my other strap, but it is not as padded as some that you'll pay a higher price for. It does the job, however. For this price you will be satisfied.", "id": 470}, {"review": "I use this for my uke, my 12 string acoustic, a parlor guitar, and my trusty Taylor. Easy to use, very accurate, highly recommended.", "id": 763}, {"review": "I don't often use a pick for my soprano uke. The Mahalo picks bring a clarity of tone that I really like, especially if I'm looking for a brighter sound.", "id": 775}]
