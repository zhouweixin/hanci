[{"review": "Very high quality they look as nice as my Fender originals .  Make sure to take your time installing them correctly and consider using a quality wood glue / adhesive during installation.  You want to make sure they can be removed at a later date without damaging the guitar .", "id": 44}, {"review": "Very nice product great quality.  I ordered three to start was not sure if I wanted to trust my Guitars to them.  Arrived installed in minutes they come with plastic toggles to screw into drywall I chose to hit studs.  Rubber washers come with to size for different necks.  If you are going to mount off a stud I strongly suggest using an aftermarket high quality toggle  made from steel.  Very happy going to order more.", "id": 154}, {"review": "It's an ok product for the price but they are weak and with a very small amount of force they will pop off.", "id": 261}, {"review": "Strap was a much better quality than expected for the cost.  Clean well packaged .  Has adjustment for length the hole size is per very good will take some working to get it on the guitar so you need not worry about slipping off.  I will still use a strap lock .  Nice product I suggest it .", "id": 661}, {"review": "I purchased this tuner for my 9 year old who is beginning guitar and it is 100% accurate and very easy to use.  His guitar instructor also commented on how accurate and simple to use.  I strongly suggest this to anyone looking for a tuner.  He connects it to his electric guitar with out amplification and gets a tune and can be connected to the amp.  If you are a beginner or seasoned player I know you will like an appreciate the tuner.  A must to keep in your bag especially for beginners, a guitar out of tune is very difficult to learn on.", "id": 706}]
