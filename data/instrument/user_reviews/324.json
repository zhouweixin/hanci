[{"review": "This is more of a like it or hate kind of item. If it doesn't work, you hate it. If it works, there's nothing impressive about a stand, so I just like it.", "id": 258}, {"review": "My old one lasted a long while and it still works. Just wanted another one. These tuners are just awesome!", "id": 707}, {"review": "This guitar is pretty good for the price. The only reason it has 4 stars is because my first and 2nd string keep detuning. Might be the weather, but strangely it keeps tune in DADGAD. I think I may need to tighten some screws. Anyway, not a bad choice at all if you want a nice classical.", "id": 774}, {"review": "Snark tuners are the most comfortable ones you can find. And they tune with amazing accuracy. If this model had a microphone to detect sound it might have been even better, but there's already another model for that. In one way it's better because sometimes the vibration and sound sensor works together to pickup other sounds while you're tuning, so this tuner is a pretty good choice.", "id": 762}, {"review": "A very decent capo. Switching is very nice and it holds down all the strings perfectly. Great for someone who plays on alternate tunings or someone who likes shifting scales often.", "id": 802}]
