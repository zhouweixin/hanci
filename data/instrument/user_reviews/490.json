[{"review": "If you perform at gigs, you know what a hassle it is transporting all your stuff to and from the venue.  This is a very handy stand for keeping your guitar upright and safe where size and weight are important considerations.  I used to bring along a much heavier stand that wasn't really designed for portability to keep my guitar from being knocked around.  This stand does the trick beautifully.  Nice job, Fender.", "id": 92}, {"review": "This little gadget is perfect if you want to stand back from your mic stand just far enough to make it comfortable to play your guitar while you sing into the mic.  The usual solution is to get a boom to attach to your stand but this works and it's simpler, less expensive and takes up less space.  The pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust.  I wouldn't try to use it if I were a singing drummer, but for a guitarist, it's great.", "id": 142}, {"review": "I play guitar and sing in relatively small places, such as cafes.  I previously used a Fender Acoustasonic Jr and I got tired of lugging it (about 50 lbs) and all of my other gig equipment around. With the CM-30 I can get it (12 lbs), mic stands, music stand, mic, and various cables and etc into a medium sized rolling duffel.  That means I can haul everthing I need in one trip.  A big plus.I like the sound quality I get.  My guitar is an acoustic Alverez with onboard preamp and my mic is a Shure SM-57.  The Roland doesn't have a huge amount of volume, but if you're looking for something that sounds natural and is easy to transport, set up and take down, this is a good choice. (If I used it a with a passive guitar pick-up, I'd want external preamp.)  Think of it as as a sound booster for when you are playing in a bigger space than your living room.I'm also thinking I will use it in larger rooms as a personal monitor with my Acoustasonic Jr.It looks really rugged, so I'm looking forward to years of happy use.", "id": 410}, {"review": "The audio jack on my laptop was failing.  I had to wiggle and twist the headphone plug until I could hear both channels.  By that time half the youtube video was over.  What a hassle!  I'm trying to imagine how can I crack the case, get in there with my soldering gun to replace the audio jack when I ran across this great idea.  A plug-and-play USB device with both input and output audio jacks.  Took about one minute to install on my Dell Inspiron, which recognized it immediately.  Problem solved quickly and elegantly.Shipping was free and prompt from the Amazon partner.  Good job, Platinum Micro, Inc.I understand the input jack is mono so don't try to use this as a quasi recording studio.  And consider the availability and accessibility of your USB ports.  Then, order this great little solution to a big problem.", "id": 569}, {"review": "I'm a big believer and long time user of many different types of visual tuning devices.  I play guitar, mandolin and ukelele.  And this inexpensive tuner is the best one I've ever used by a long way.  I've paid a lot more for a lot less.  It has an option to use either an internal vibration sensor via the clip or a built in microphone.  The dial is easily readable and adjustable to a wide range of viewing angles.  And it has the fastest and best response of any tuner I've ever used.  It doesn't require a loud volume to \"hear\" the tone.  Finally, it doesn't seem to wander around trying to attune itself to the note you just played, but it does instantly sense very fine differences in that tone.  If I detune by about 1/16th of a turn on my tuning machine (an difference I can't hear with my own ear), this device detects it immediately.  All in all, this thing is a whole step up in accuracy in tuning.", "id": 707}]
