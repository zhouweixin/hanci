[{"review": "Only complaint is the size which is my fault. If you can buy at least a 15 foot if you plan to use it on stage.", "id": 6}, {"review": "Good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practice.This was my first guitar strap i had ever bought. I didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by. Over the 6 months ive had it i took it off my electric guitar and put it on a new electric acoustic I recently got and it keeps popping off. This is a problem is standing up playing at a gig or just around your house. The guitar could take that head dive of death, while one dive might not do too much damage a few might crack the neck or worse.My Advice: unless you plan to sit and play (which you wont really need a strap anyways) the whole time, spend alittle more to get a leather strap. Spending more on a leather strap will help avoid hole stretching and the popping off of the strap in mid play.", "id": 208}, {"review": "Slinky is used by tons of professionals because they work well and endure rough playing.These strings are pretty much an upgrade from any factory strings.change yours now.", "id": 226}, {"review": "Great for a beginner electric.Needed new strings but everything else was smooth.Pick up a set of slinky strings and all is well.", "id": 555}, {"review": "For my first gig bag its ok. I since then bought a new alvarez acoustic electric which i will be buying a hard case simply because the build quality and protection isnt there in a padded case. I have had this padded bag for a year now with light use and edges are starting to tare and rip. Also i am concerned that the zippers might get stuck and break at any moment. I will be replacing this with a hard cases as soon as i buy one for my alvarez.", "id": 863}]
