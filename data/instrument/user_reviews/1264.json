It is my first condenser mic, and at $149 it is a steal.I've always used Shure or Heil mics that cost over $250... This mic in a studio application smokes them.  It is obviously more clear and pure the moment you try it.  But if you really want to be amazed, do an A/B comparison.This mic has convinced me to  purchase the Audio-Technica  AT4040.  Cant wait to get it and I will review it also.", "id": 642}, {"review": "I could not be happier... Excellent sound, easy controls, very responsive and is better than advertised.  The effects are excellent, and feel and quality of parts are wonderful.  Buy it.", "id": 652}, {"review": "Great for the beginner!", "id": 693}, {"review": "Great pickup, combined with the Fishman Aura Spectrum D.I. you will have an excellent experience.  Even the pick up by itself into a quality amp will make you happy.", "id": 56}, {"review": "excellent", "id": 123}, {"review": "Quiet and durable", "id": 169}, {"review": "good strings", "id": 198}, {"review": "Best strings ever", "id": 204}, {"review": "Light weight but sturdy enough", "id": 279}]
