[{"review": "This thing does just what it was supposed to, i use it on my practice bass since i use any type of picks on that, and it does just what it is supposed to", "id": 29}, {"review": "I don't know if this is a common problem, but i have these on both of my basses, and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing, like metal does before it rusts, it is literally only one of the arms out of 4 i have so i think it was just a random thing. The problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn't just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose, and one time (the first time) i didn't notice and it actually fell out. Notice i still like the product, this was just one of those things i think, so I would still recommend it.", "id": 44}, {"review": "I usually keep pick in my mouth when I don't use them but sometimes I drop them, and at a show you do not have time to bend down and grab it, so this is a nice option to have a spare one, if you use bass picks, get this, it is bigger than the guitar version, much like the picks.", "id": 175}, {"review": "The best part of this pick is that it is easier on my strings, it still gives the pick tone, but seems to do less damage.", "id": 243}, {"review": "I actually use these on my bass if my fingers are too worn from heavy playing, they have the same sound as a finger on a string, it is actually a really neat thing to have in my bag. I recomend trying one out some time.", "id": 695}]
