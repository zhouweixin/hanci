But I probably won't get these again..... Ever.", "id": 156}, {"review": "It makes restringing way easier it's pretty stable and sturdy. It will work on pretty much any guitar. So far iv used it on my 6,7 electrics and my Taylor acoustic.", "id": 163}, {"review": "I use this on my spider iv 75 it works great I've had it for about 2 months and no issues.", "id": 621}, {"review": "It only cost around $20 so my expectations weren't very high to begin with but right out of the box it had a hole in the stitching and the front pocket was sown on crooked. I don't plan on keeping it long.", "id": 865}, {"review": "I've been using this stuff for about 8 years or so and I really don't play without it it makes chord changes faster and easier and your fingers slide real easy.", "id": 173}, {"review": "I use this for working on my guitars mainly. It does the job well and is pretty large. It's very soft and padded as well as anti static.", "id": 705}, {"review": "This thing is crap right out of the box it had holes in the stitching and all the pockets were sown on crooked. What can you expect for $20 tho. This was a temporary solution I don't recommend this for long term use it will probably fall apart.", "id": 863}]
