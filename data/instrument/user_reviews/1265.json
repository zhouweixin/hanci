[{"review": "Just a basic female XLR to 1/4 inch male adapter. I use these so I can plug my regular mic cables into my keyboard/practice all in one PA.", "id": 12}, {"review": "These are great strings. Nice bright tone. The three pack was the best deal when I ordered them. Get some!", "id": 198}, {"review": "This guitar strap performs as expected for it's price. Great entry level guitar strap for those just getting started (or for a backup strap).", "id": 470}, {"review": "I like cool gadgets - and this is no exception. The red color is a metallic color - and I totally dig it. The display is nice and bright as well. Super accurate tuning. Well worth it for the price.", "id": 707}, {"review": "This product is straight forward and works as it's intended.One side note - there is a pretty loud squeak that occurs when winding the strings. I'm not sure if all of them do this but the one I received does. It doesn't cause any problem with the product's performance... it's just loud.", "id": 94}]
