[{"review": "It winds well and can cut off excess string thereafter. The design also includes a bridge pin puller that comes in handy. With some acquired technique this tool does a job.", "id": 94}, {"review": "I received a selection of pics for a reasonable price. The variety of materials and thicknesses offered good opportunity to explore my options.", "id": 773}, {"review": "This is the best tuner I've used in over a decade of playing various instruments. The design is well conceived for guitar players and the results are spot on.  Overall ease of tuning and ability to do so in a noisy environment are well worth the $14 I paid.I like the ability to change the overall tuning to different standards [e.g. Baroque or NY Philharmonic] and the included metronome is also nice to have. Perhaps the most useful feature is that this unit will tune any note; guitar players can spot check a fretted tone and other musicians can tune to C or another preferred note that some guitar tuners do not have.Mine broke where the arm connects to the back of the main unit. There is a ball and socket joint and two of the socket flanges broke. Glue and a rubber band now holds it together. I mention this so that you won't put yours in a tight exterior pocket on a gig bag or otherwise smash it into a broken state.", "id": 811}, {"review": "This bit of leather and a button spared my acoustic surgery to add a second strap mount. I am happy with the function and it looks good in combination with an Ernie Ball strap. The raised star on the button adds a touch of design interest.", "id": 877}, {"review": "This strap works well, looks good, and is comfortable to wear. The choice of colors and durable material are two strengths. Price was good for a useful accessory.", "id": 282}]
