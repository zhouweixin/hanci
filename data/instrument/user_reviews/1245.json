[{"review": "This is a pack of guitar strings.  It sounds good on my guitar and it's not that expensive.  I like it(4 star rating according to amazon).  I would rate it 5 stars(amazon rating for 5 stars is if you 'love' the product),if it made me sound like Clapton unfortunately, none of the gear that I bought can do this!  Also, I kind of find it hard to 'love' a pack of guitar strings.", "id": 226}, {"review": "I ordered this and it arrived surprisingly quickly.  It arrived in a large box and within in the Fender Amp box.  I guess 2 boxes is good as it provides more protection.  Sadly, when I tried to use them amp, it didn't work!  I checked the wall plug, cord, flicked several switches and knobs but still didn't work.  Needless to say, I sent the amp back to Amazon which was quick and painless.  I wanted an exchange.  I expected the amp to be received and check out and only then a exchange amp sent to me.  But I was shocked to find out that as soon as the return UPS label was recorded at the UPS store, they shipped out another amp.  And it arrived in 4 days since I returned the first one!  WOW!!! That's customer service.The amp is great.  Small footprint, sounds great for what I want it for which is bedroom/basement practice amp.  Does it's job very nicely.  I explored the FUSE software and the potential is almost endless.  Honestly, I don't think I will every fully utilize the full capability of the FUSE software.  I just need some basic sound and some simple tweeking here and there.  I may use someone else's uploaded presets and play with the various options later on.  In summary, 5 stars for the amp and 5 stars for the customer service.", "id": 718}, {"review": "As the title, it works the way it's supposed to.  But I wish the rubber part that sits on the table is thicker and heavier so it won't move easily.  Nevertheless, it's a low cost way to set your guitar against the desk without scratching the back of the neck and preventing the guitar from sliding down from the desk and falling on the ground.  Just remember, use some common sense, don't expect the guitar to totally stable.", "id": 746}, {"review": "You have to pay a lot more at a guitar store for something like this.  Granted it doesn't look as nice but it does its job.  I put couple of them up and have my guitar hanging  on it without any problem.", "id": 779}, {"review": "Quick snap on and off. Sturdy.  If it is not convenient, it won't be used.  In this case, it is very convenient and easy to use, hence, your prized guitar will not drop to the floor by accident.  Well worth the money spent!", "id": 44}, {"review": "guitar string 9.5 between 9 and 10.  Does its job for those who want strings that are easier to bend than 10 and not as noodlely as 9.", "id": 196}, {"review": "I was really interested in the M3 and checked with the Fender forum and I found that there is a problem with the M3.  You can go to the Fender forum and read about it under the Mustang amp section.To make the long story short, some(not all) M3, M4, M5's have what is decribed as a \"fizz\" on the clean setting when hitting the low e string.  Sometimes it's noticably loud and sometimes it is barely audible.  Some people think it's the power supply but nobody knows for sure.  Apparently, Fender has not made a statement to its cause although they admitted that there is a 'fizz' problem.  There is also a sample sound clip there on this 'fizz'.Like I said, I just want people to know about this before buying a M3. Now, I am considering the M2 which also has the 'fizz' problem but with the the software fix released from Fender, there is no 'fizz' in the M2. I don't know if it is fair for me to give it a rating because I didn't get the M3, but if I bought it, I would give it a rating of 3 stars because I don't like this 'fizz' on the clean setting and it would be unusable for me.  If it didn't have this 'fizz' I would give it a 5 star rating.", "id": 737}]
