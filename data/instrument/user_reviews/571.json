Didn't test microphones yet, but I think this is best price for 7 microphones. According to the rewievs the sound quality should be quite well. I'll check it later.", "id": 689}, {"review": "Item shipped earlier than I've expected. When I opened the box was surprised as I didn't notice the usb cable. But later I thought that it was impossible and opened the box from another side and here it was...I have plugged and installed usb driver and dedicated software in a few seconds. It is working fine. Though it has no motorized faders, it doesn't make my work uncomfortable at all. I have connected it to a Reaper and Protools software and it's just working perfect!I recommend it to home studios, also those who travel with recording gear. Nano is small but quite durable.I am happy with it!", "id": 741}, {"review": "Microphone is quite good for such price. The sound is clear but still quite far from first class microphones. Recommend for small budget studios.", "id": 254}, {"review": "The item shipped in time. It is working fine. The sound is very good. The only problem I had is voltage. I live in Europe and I had to buy special adapter which transforms 220 volts to 120.I know A lot of items from USA that work with both voltage 220 and 110, but not this one.Thanks anyway.", "id": 376}]
