[{"review": "It's a good OD, but I thought it would be higher output, and more articulate. Just personal preference. I mean, the Pedal is a Classic for a reason.", "id": 38}, {"review": "MXR make pretty good Pedals for the money. I thought that this would be a high output, saturated type distortion. It is not. It has plent of Volume, which is good for boosting. But, even with the Gain Knob turned all the way up, this thing is an Overdrive. Which is not a bad thing, if that's what you are looking for. Very Mid-Rangey sound as well. Just not for me. But it's well built and would make a decent OD. But, overall, a pretty Vanilla flavored Dirt Pedal.", "id": 460}, {"review": "A very boring, dull, uninspiring Pedal. Don't waste your time with this. A Boss SD-1 or Digitech Bad Monkey are far better options for this price range.", "id": 833}, {"review": "Buy this. It's cheap and better than Fuzz pedals that cost 6 times as much. It can go from a clean boost to a slight octave up fuzz that has to be heard.....Amazing sounds!", "id": 450}, {"review": "A dull, inept version of a TubeScreamer. Just sounds flat and boring. Not very inspiring. At all. (Then again, I never did really like TS's).......", "id": 728}]
