[{"review": "I have restored an old REX Commander.  Yeah, I know;  never heard of it.  Beautiful old archtop acoustic with real mother of pearl rectangular inlays on the neck.  Frets filed nearly flat after over a half century of playing.  But the resonance of the D'Addario's really bring this old guitar to life with a thick juicy vibrance on the bass side, and bell like clarity on the treble side.  Not to mention how great they look.  The snap and sparkle of the responsiveness of these stings amazes me.  Terrific strings for the price of cheapies.", "id": 198}, {"review": "Finishing a build for a customer, without these, would have been a real problem.  Also used these for the tremolo back cover.  Very handy.  And no digging the the parts bin for screws.", "id": 215}, {"review": "I have an abundance of strat parts.  So when a vintage non-strat type guitar came acrossed my workbench, I plunked these on the pots.  The customer liked them so much, he kept them on.  Now what to do with these other knobs?", "id": 221}, {"review": "I could never get the sound I wanted using other manufacturers strings.  I tried Ernie Ball Slinkys just for shiggles.  I was quite surprised at the quality of the tone I get from my guitars now.  There is a rich, toney presence to these springs.  The cheapest and most effective upgrade you can make on your axe is Ernie Ball strings.  Hands down the best.", "id": 226}, {"review": "Very nice quality part.  Fit the trem very snugly until some of the chrome plating was removed. But my Mexi-Strat is now complete.", "id": 558}, {"review": "Promptly received, nicely packaged with protective film on it.  Little bit of fiddling with it to get the holes lined up, but overall a very nice part.  Compliments my B/W/B pickgaurd nicely. Open slot in the back much more convenient than the series of holes, normally found.", "id": 562}, {"review": "Spent next to nothing on this part, but it saved the day on a side project for a friend.  Thank God I buy spares. this simple and admittedly cheap little part enabled me to finish a project quickly. It doesn't get any more elemental, but I soldered it in and it's doing fine.  Not for real heavy usage anyway.", "id": 674}, {"review": "There's no substitute for the right part. These are great.  I like having extras around, just in case I rescue another orphaned guitar, to rebuild.  The springs are almost always missing. Cost less here, than at Guitar Center, so bada-bing!", "id": 676}, {"review": "You can mess around swapping parts, pickups, and capacitors.  But the biggest change I've experienced is with the tone block change. The Mexi Tremolo bolted right in to all my Strats and even my MIK Squier.  It went from thin and tinny, to being a real tone monster, with superb sustain.  The combination of the mass of the tone block, and flat steel saddles, has given me the exact sound i was looking for.  Couldn't be happier.", "id": 678}, {"review": "I wanted to add to my pedal arsenal, but I didn't have the big bucks to spend on a Tube Screamer. So, I took a chance on this little stomp-box from China.  It compares itself to the TS, right on the box, and for good reason.  They use the same chip. More importantly, the construction is solid, good looking, and takes up minimal pedal-board space.  The on-off switch seems a little chintzy, but the tone that comes out of this thing is awesome. I only found that out after replacing the dead battery that it comes with, and plugging in to a power supply (not provided with unit).  It turned my partscaster into a blues making machine. It's responds well to your technique, and you can make it so funky, you can smell it!  It truly does have true bypass, and logical controls.  I don't have A TS to make direct comparisons, but for the money, this little pedal gives me exactly the tone I want.  And I saved about 70 or 80 bucks.  Ba-Da Bing!", "id": 728}, {"review": "Not much to screw up.  Good quality parts, on an essential product.  Brain-dead simple install. And no surprises; works like a champ!", "id": 218}, {"review": "Recieved the accessory kit, only to find I was missing the black tip for the five-way switch and tremolo bar tip.  Trem back cover fit nicely and the knobs help me complete a few other project.  Saving the p/u covers for my next project, but it would be nice to get the trem tip and switch tip sent to me.Great customer service.  Received missing parts, immediately.  Finished the project.  I definitely will be using this seller again.  Thanks", "id": 222}]
