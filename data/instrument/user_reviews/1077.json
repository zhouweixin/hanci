[{"review": "As a beginner playing guitar I was looking for something mid range and this is it.  It holds tune and has not failed yet.  Since I am just starting it gets a lot of use with practice.  As I get better I will upgrade.So far the only maintenance has been to tune it and clean the strings and that is normal.", "id": 183}, {"review": "I don't know who would need better unless you traveled a lot where you might need the hard case.  This one surpassed my expectations.Months into using the Gig Bag and not a single problem.  The pockets are packed with books, tools, and strings.The shoulder straps make carrying the bag across town a breeze.", "id": 309}, {"review": "This was the easiest tuner I had.  I am sorry I gave it away now when I upgraded.  LOL", "id": 331}, {"review": "I was looking for a better quality Mic but not willing to pay a high price to sing on the Internet.  This was a low price and high quality solution.  Nothing to load and I was singing right out of the box.It does pick up noise around me since this is a condenser mic but, that just means you pick a quiet place to record.. LOL", "id": 525}, {"review": "The Nanoweb strings do stay clean and they stand up but, on the negative side...I replaced one string in my set with a nanoweb and noticed right away the feel was slippery. When picking my fingers would slip on the nano string rather than pluck.  I will stick to cleaning my good old standard strings.", "id": 104}]
