[{"review": "This is the first guitar pick I ever played with and to this day is my favorite type.  Nice and thin and flexible, but not so flexible that you can't bend it for single picking.  I'm torn between this style, out of nostalgia, and the blue version-because I love blue.", "id": 117}, {"review": "I always played with the brown colored 351s growing up, but I love the blue finish on these.  I'd recommend the 351 Fender picks over any others personally but I'm very partial to blue as well, so these are perfect.", "id": 120}, {"review": "These cables are very high quality, they feel hefty and durable.  I wish I'd gotten one longer than 5 feet though since I can only play close to my amp with two five footers.  Oh, well.", "id": 195}, {"review": "I love the concept and design of these picks save one flaw-the rubber gripping goes down too far on the pick.  I don't know any guitar players that have their thumb on the entire pick, and since it goes down so far it's hard to pick clean without hitting the rubber on the strings sometimes.  I do love how they bend in the middle and the grippy rubber but I think they should scale the rubberization back a little bit.", "id": 503}, {"review": "This might be a really, really nice stand, but the one I received was defective-one of the small top separator arms that keep the guitar necks apart was unattached and won't attach, so I have to return it for a refund.  I'll probably buy another one afterward with the hopes that it's intact this time.", "id": 769}]
