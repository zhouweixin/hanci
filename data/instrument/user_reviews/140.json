[{"review": "Replaced the plastic saddle in my Yamaha F335BL. Had to file it to make it thinner, and filed it down to make it shorter than the old saddle, this made the action a bit lower and made it easier to play for a beginner. It did change the sound of the guitar, it sounds fuller, and the sustain is longer.", "id": 415}, {"review": "I am a beginner guitar player. I have a Yamaha F335BL and a Hohner HC06.  I bought the Yamaha a few years back, and just recently started to really learning to play it.  It sounds ok, but not great (though the Price is pretty good for it)  It is all laminated, and the action is pretty high.Looking online I saw that people really liked the Seagull S6 Original for its sound and price point. Boy were they right. I got this guitar from Guitar Center (after I tried it out)  The action is low, and the fretboard is bigger (for fingerstyle and beginners this is really good).  The sound is also REALLY good, its very resonant, and just sounds &#34;good&#34;.  It is hard to describe the sound, you woul dhave to hear it.I did replace the pins with Presentation Tusq Pins, I could not really tell a difference in sound, but it did make it look nicer.Highly recommend this and other guitars from Seagull (try the Merlin, its fun)", "id": 432}, {"review": "This is a very inexpensive and very accurate tuner.  The Vibration Mode is really good. I am a new guitar player, and this item has helped me greatly in quickly tuning my guitar.", "id": 707}, {"review": "I replaced the older strings in my acoustic guitar.  While these strings are a bit harder to play (they are not forgiving on the fingertips of people just learning how to play) they do sound great. A lot better than the stock strings that came with the guitar.", "id": 717}, {"review": "If you bought Rocksmith 2014, and use an electric guitar, get this.  The cobalt strings are picked up very well by the magnetic pickups, and in turn Rocksmith detects the strings A LOT better. I had problems with the game picking up frats 12 and up.  After getting these the game picks them all up now.", "id": 825}, {"review": "This Capo looks great and does the job. It does take a bit of pressure to open the camp, but its better then the winding versions.", "id": 25}]
