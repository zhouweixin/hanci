It was a good deal, did the job.", "id": 556}, {"review": "Well built, easy setup, very quiet.

Trick: treat your room with sound deadening.", "id": 644}, {"review": "Cool design, makes a big difference in you audio. Even careful hand tightening will break the thumbscrew. Screw is actually two pieces (wtf?) of worlds crappiest pot metal.  Supposedly a new tightener design is on the way.", "id": 780}]
