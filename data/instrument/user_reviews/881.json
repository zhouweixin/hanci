[{"review": "I bought one of these for each of my electric guitars (3) and really like them. They work great, were easy to assemble, and not expensive. I do think the name is a bit inapproriate because I would never use one on stage, I don't think they are sturdy enough. These are great if you don't have to worry about pets or children possibly bumping into them. I realize you won't normally have pets or children on stage, but sometimes there are people moving around and guitars do get knocked over. I recommend the On Stage XCG4 for home use or if you have a practice room where you know your guitar is safe. I use these primarily for electric guitars but also have one for an acoustic and it fits very nicely. Great deal for the very low price.", "id": 258}, {"review": "I bought these to replace the plastic bridge pins that came on my Fender acoustic. These are easy to install using the instructions (or without). These are also sturdy and look very good.", "id": 263}, {"review": "I have Schaller Security Strap Locks on all but one of my guitars and will probably purchase Schallers for that one soon. These give you an added sense of security because they can be adjusted to work with gravity, the post sits in the lock rather that depending just on springs to hold it in place. My Larrivee RS-4 came with these and converted me to Schaller.", "id": 278}, {"review": "Great strap for the price. Absolutely no complaints/issues at all. Light weight but sturdy. I was able to put strap locks on this strap with no issues and it works great. Comfortable as well.", "id": 632}, {"review": "I selected this to replace the cheap plastic Saddle that came on my Fender acoustic. This was a tremendous upgrade and made a difference in the tone and 'brightness' of the sound. This was easy to install and comes with easy to understand instructions.", "id": 415}]
