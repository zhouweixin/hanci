[{"review": "Got this to use with the Behringer compressor I ordered with this. They are not indicated as compatible but it worked great! Price was right. I already own two and had no problems. Quiet. No hummmmm. Buy it if you need a wall wart.", "id": 40}, {"review": "Let's face it, I'm sure there are better compressors than this for about 3 to 4 times the price but this brought my amp into the light. Bright, crisp, clean, balanced sound reproduction. Got the Danelectro wall wart for it. Worked great. The free shipping was lighting fast and I got more than I bargain for. Get one!", "id": 454}, {"review": "If you can read the tiny little screen, this thing records nicely. But it's a pain in the Axx to move from one selection to the other. There were a couple of times I almost threw against the wall. It has a tendency to completely freeze up and the on/off switch does nothing. You have to pull the batteries out and reinstall them for the damn thing to work again.", "id": 463}, {"review": "This \"would\" be a great digital reverb but for the fact that the more you turn the level up on the reverb intensity, it simultaneously fades the initial attach of the strum, pluck or riff rendering the reverb relatively worthless if you 'want a lot of reverb\". What the hell was Behringer thinking???", "id": 545}, {"review": "Put this through an AC30C2 and prepare to be amazed. Never owned an OCD but I don't need to. My neighbors I'm sure are not pleased. Many have decribed this pedal and there is nothing else like it at this price point! It's your guitar on steriods. Crisp deplication of it with bass, treble and a little hair on it. That's at the 25% gain setting. Flip from low to high micro switch and hold on to your balls. From nasty blues to Steppenwolf you will have it covered.", "id": 795}]
