[{"review": "Simply one of the best string winders I have ever used to date and I love it because I having large hands it really makes a difference. Not forget the added string cutter and peg puller to boot.

Awesome.", "id": 415}, {"review": "Since this my first Snark SN-1 Tuner I am very pleased with performance it gives me accurate read outs against built in tuners on the guitars (Acoustic) that is. Like all all functions it has looking forward to maybe upgrading to the next model or so just have a few around for each instrument.", "id": 706}, {"review": "I purchased this to use until I get the replacement to my Ovation CC28 and it is load and clean. For $20.00 it is worth all day.", "id": 789}, {"review": "These screws fit my project guitar perfectly and considering it was an older Epiphone by Gibson S-900 that I opted to add a pick guard too, the screws fit everything perfectly. The look of the screws was even better than the cheap one you find on most import and low end made guitars the have the fat heads and strip really easy. I will purchase again for my next build.", "id": 215}]
