[{"review": "It works pretty well on my ukulele, however it left several dents and scratches on the tuners of my ukulele.", "id": 94}, {"review": "Its easy to set up and use. Simple instructions are on a sticker on the bottom of it. I re soak it easy 2-3 weeks or so. Can't tell if it's truly working on my maple wood ukulele.", "id": 314}, {"review": "Item is as described. You receive 3 felt picks, plus a bonus ant hill music pick. (mine was purple) Picks were defect free, but the bonus pick was noticeably dusty from the felt picks, which a clean moist cloth will easily fix. But because the picks were a bit dusty it could transfer to your instrument. None the less the picks make my uke sound louder but you may be hearing the pick a little bit. But over time this starts to disappear. The picks are pretty comfy to hold.", "id": 695}, {"review": "They sound pretty good. They tend to get un tuned pretty easily the first few days then they stay in tune for ages with minor adjustments.", "id": 698}, {"review": "A perfect fit! Plus it comes with a handle, strap and a nice sized pocket where you can store picks, capos, straps and strings. Its great for getting my uke from point a to b safely. Would recommend it.", "id": 845}]
