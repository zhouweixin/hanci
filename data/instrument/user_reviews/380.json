[{"review": "Sounds great. I own 5 different gauges. I like the gripping surface. .90 is my favorite gauge and the rounded tip is super fast.", "id": 54}, {"review": "Smooth sound and attack. Grips soft, loose, and yet well. I own HUNDREDS of picks. These are some of my favorites.", "id": 65}, {"review": "I should've just got this cable the first time. I have been using Monster for years. I recently tried a coiled guitar cable and learned the hard way.", "id": 126}, {"review": "Stable and precise pick attack. Excellent choice for the aggressive guitar player. I am buying more gauges too. They last forever.", "id": 162}, {"review": "Working great on my Stratocaster. Excellent purchase. Feels good to switch positions solid and quiet. I should've bought this to replace the original switch from the start.", "id": 214}, {"review": "I have replaced my old tarnished screws with these. They fit great and plenty of screws. I am going to replace all my old screws with these.", "id": 215}, {"review": "Perfect for my guitars. Sounds great for my telecaster and my Stratocaster guitars. Capacitor are a nice generalized  choice. Excellent choice.", "id": 216}, {"review": "This pickguard was used. It not only was missing the protective plastic but it actually was scratched from being on a guitar before.", "id": 217}, {"review": "First wax I have bought. I usually don't wax. I tend to use cleaning sprays. I am going to be waxing now on. Gerlitz makes this wax easy, not greasy. This tin should last a lifetime. It comes with an applicator designed for contours of guitars. I would use just the minimal amount and still get a mirrorglaze. Leaves no ffingerprints or smudges. My classical guitar sounds better after a dose of the GERLITZ GNO NO 1 CARNUBA GUITAR WAX!!!!!", "id": 336}, {"review": "Unique product offering new kind of protection from fingerprints, dust, oxidation, squeaks, or &#34;gummy areas&#34;. 2 or 3 drops on a cotton ball and treat several guitars. This is a thin viscosity lube that shines your woodgrain better than new. I don't like greasy feeling products on my guitars so Dr. Duck 2080 Ax Wax is designed for my needs. I threw  out my Gibson spray. Too oily. Dr.Ducks Wax is worth the extra $3. This bottle will last a lifetime. You could use it on your Johnson if you wack off the finish.", "id": 348}, {"review": "Nice grip. Sound articulate. Durable. Nice!!!!! I own HUNDREDS of picks and this is my new favorite. I bought 2 gauges. Both are going to be used for years.", "id": 626}, {"review": "Most the reverb selection sound identical. They all sound good. I would say that the Boss reverb pedal sounds better. I use this pedal in my pedal chain. It doesn't get much action, my amp has a reverb. I was looking for trippy modern hifidelity effects on my guitar.", "id": 748}, {"review": "I have been using D'adario strings for 30 years. They sound great. They stay in tune. Excellent sustain. I can get better string control compared to other strings. I have never experienced a string break in 30 years.", "id": 156}, {"review": "If you expect to get what you pay for, prepare to be disappointed. Sounds weak. Sounds old. Sounds worn. Sounds dull. I wanted to experience a new brand on my Stratocaster. I can afford to pay twice as much. But I am going to keep using my D'adario Strings from now on. I am so disappointed. These strings are for the &#34;campfire guitarist&#34; not the aggressive picking thrilling, tapping, pull offs, or sweepers. If you are a tone fanatic keep looking. If your guitar deserves the best, do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings. Respect your GUITAR.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are made from China.", "id": 205}, {"review": "Could be more tapered for such a tiny pick. But the material is AWESOME. Nice grip even more so when I sweat.", "id": 413}]
