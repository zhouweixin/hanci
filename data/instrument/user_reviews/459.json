[{"review": "Nice cushion on both sides,  on-string and the back of the arm. Stays very firm on the arm. It'll stay still even if you accidentally bump on it while playing.The 4-star is just to alert that it may be a problem for people with not so strong hands, like kids,  as the spring is very tough.", "id": 116}, {"review": "There's not much to say about this pick. I like medium picks and this feels comfortable.They wear a bit faster than I would expect, but far rom being a problem. It may just be my style.The 12-pack seems a good balance between cost and quantity.", "id": 162}, {"review": "The product arrived as in the description, but I made the mistake to buy it for my Fender Squier Bullet (not a \"full\" Strat).There are 2 differences between this pickup covers and my Fender Squier: First, the magnet tips in the Squier are closer together.  I guess the fretboard is narrower than the Strats. Second, the Squier's has a dent on the bottom to allow the wires to go out on the side of the pickup.My solution here was to drill the holes wider and the dent. Not the most beautiful thing but worked.The other parts (knob, backplate and tips) fit perfectly.", "id": 222}, {"review": "This is a great glass slide, but the ring size seems to be smaller than announced. My finger stays too tight. Not uncomfortable, but it takes some effort to get it out.", "id": 281}, {"review": "It's odd to review such a simple thing as screws :-)What can I say? They're shiny and screwed well into the holes.", "id": 599}, {"review": "... might be my abusive bends though ;-)  I'll try a ticker gauge next time.Other than that, great strings.", "id": 667}]
