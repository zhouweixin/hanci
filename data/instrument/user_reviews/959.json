[{"review": "This is the best shockmount in my opinion (This is the first shock mount I have tried.). I bought it with a desktop mic stand, and used it on my Audio Technica AT2020 and it worked very nicely. It does the perfect job for podcasting, as well as gameplay videos. I would recommend this to anyone.", "id": 393}, {"review": "I bought this microphone for youtube/podcasting and it does a REALLY perfect job. The quality is great for me. It was what I had expected it to be. I also bought a desktop mic stand with it, as well as a shockmount and popfilter. Highly recommended.", "id": 525}, {"review": "This is a really amazing portable Midi Keyboard. This is great for anyone wanting to create music while traveling. I've had no problems with it and the beat pads are really firm, but nice. You have to use a lot of pressure on the pads, but oh well. It is perfect. PLUS There are soo many settings and options to play with, as well as setting the knobs on the keyboard to do whatever you need it to do. Works amazing in FL Studio.", "id": 723}, {"review": "IT DOES THE JOB. It is nice and it fits well on my desktop mic stand and it looks nice infront of my Shockmount that holds my Audio Technica AT2020", "id": 842}, {"review": "I loved it very much. It is very sturdy and stable. It holds my shockmount with my Audio Technica AT2020 just perfectly and it does an amazing job.", "id": 224}]
