I like them.", "id": 22}, {"review": "There's not much to say about this product other than it can hold up a beer or water bottle really darn well. Mounting it to the stand took all of 30 seconds and if feels sturdy as can be.", "id": 530}, {"review": "They are well built and can hold almost any speaker system you throw at them. I have already recommended these to a friend and he bought them. He likes them too.", "id": 655}, {"review": "Great stereo sound out of the keyboards.My keys had a single 1/4&#34; stereo out so this cable was needed to get it to convert to a true 2 channel stereo so we could EQ it properly and it worked like a charm. I highly recommend this cable.", "id": 9}, {"review": "As I mentioned in the title, this simply snaps to the stand and holds picks. Enough said.
