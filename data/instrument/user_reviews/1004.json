[{"review": "Great universal power supply for your pedals, and the ability to mount it under your board makes it awesome. I have two of these that I mount under my board and they power all my pedals perfectly. Would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a unit to power all their pedals with, and you won't get any noise interference with its isolated outputs.", "id": 209}, {"review": "Allows me to keep picks on my mic stand for quick access if I need to grab a new one or drop one. Fits nice and snug on the mic stand and the picks are also snug into the holder. Would recommend to anyone looking for an easy solution to having picks ready to go!", "id": 210}, {"review": "The best tuner for your board in my opinion! Great display, easy to view/read, and a simple click on and off that isn't noisy. Since it is true bypass the pedal turns off when it is not engaged, which is a great feature since the battery will not drain while not in use even when things are plugged into it. Silent on/off, and I have two of them. Recommend this to anybody looking for a tuner for their rig.", "id": 504}, {"review": "I love this tape for multiple reasons, one because when it's on, it's on and not going to come off with bumps or gigging hard or what not, but at the same time if you would need to reassemble your board and want to move pedals around, you can take it off. It won't be easy, but if you get some leverage on it with a flathead or something you can wedge it off. I was able to get everything off my older board, and it came off so clean I was actually able to sell it! So this is some good stuff! Be prepared to buy a few rolls though for an entire board of pedals, as it hooks to itself so you'll go through it pretty quickly.", "id": 765}, {"review": "I've been using this for my ipad for chord sheets as I play on a weekly basis and it has been great! Being able to not have to use a music stand and having it right below me attached to the mic stand is really convenient. It grips really nicely and attaches itself onto the mic stand really easily. I've owned it for a while now and haven't had any problems with it.", "id": 831}, {"review": "For being so cheap, this pickup works surprisingly great. Was just looking for something quick and easy to mic a violin at a decent quality, and this did the job perfectly!", "id": 848}]
