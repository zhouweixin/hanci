[{"review": "The primary job of this device is to block the breath that would otherwise produce a popping sound, while allowing your voice to pass through with no noticeable reduction of volume or high frequencies. The double cloth filter blocks the pops and lets the voice through with no coloration. The metal clamp mount attaches to the mike stand secure enough to keep it attached. The goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it.", "id": 0}, {"review": "Every time I have ever used a desk mike, I've always had to lean into it because the stand was too short. This little stand adjusts about six inches, so it's possible to get the mike right at mouth level without bending over.", "id": 224}, {"review": "If you find yourself in need of a desk mount for your microphone, this one works well. It is heavy enough to keep the microphone from tipping over, and the black anodized stem gives a subtle appearance on the desk. Having the microphone always plugged in, accessible on the desk and ready to go means I save much setup time for my voice-over work.", "id": 250}, {"review": "The black mike stand blends in to the background better than silver. It fits standard microphone mounts and has a wire clip to keep the wire from being pulled away from the base.", "id": 515}, {"review": "After first receiving the wrong item (not a mike at all) Amazon promptly corrected the error and sent the microphone ordered.This microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the XLR connector mates firmly with most cables. The included cable is light duty, but not bad if you treat it with respect. For under twenty dollars, Pyle-Pro can't be beat. Just be mindful it's inexpensive because it's made in China, but it doesn't feel cheap in any way.The mike exhibits rich vocal tone throughout the midrange and upper registers while the low end is slightly attenuated. For most singers, it will be just what they need. The cardiod pattern reduces feedback and background noise, making it a nice announcers mike for corporate video production.One issue I have with this mike is when using it on a Tascam D40 portable recorder with an XLR to XLR cable, the Tascam generates a digital pulsing noise into the input electronics. Both of my Pyle Pro mikes have the same problem, but both mikes work perfectly with any other device. The Tascam D40 is known for this noise issue, but it usually only occurs using an unbalanced non-XLR input. In this case, the unbalanced cable that comes with the mike actually works better with the Tascam than the XLR to XLR cable.", "id": 690}, {"review": "This microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the XLR connector mates firmly with most cables.

My only complaint is they come packaged in a bag that allows them to be crushed and mis-shaped upon delivery. If your mike has a big enough ball, the ball will reshape the foam. Otherwise the foam will never have that nice smooth, round look to it.", "id": 778}]
