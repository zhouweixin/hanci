I recommend it.", "id": 321}, {"review": "Good strings. Light... but I'll be going to coated strings next.  The coated ones are Medium, which is too heavy for me.", "id": 408}, {"review": "Great little tuner.  Easy to work with and also easy to find.  The price is also right and I recommend.", "id": 707}, {"review": "Picks are personal thing and even then everyone seems to change once in a while.  I really like the feel of this hard little pick with the round edge, which gives a warm round sound, but if you like to have the bluegrass banjo sound, all you need to do is file down one edge to what you'd like and you can have it all.  Great pick, I recommend it.", "id": 771}, {"review": "Excellent!  Mother's Little Helper!  Highly recommend this item.  It a rubber like stuff and will not damage the instrument. A Must.", "id": 211}]
