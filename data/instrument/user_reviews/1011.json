[{"review": "it can hold the weight of any of my guitars. its easy to install and i guess its cheap. it doesnt always come with the screw covers but that doesnt really matter", "id": 154}, {"review": "it sticks on forever and holds lots of picks. It does exactly what it says it does. its also very cheap.", "id": 167}, {"review": "The mandolin arrived on time and came in a box within a box where the mandolin was wrapped. There was no damage to it and none of the tuning pegs broke. I tuned it pretty easily and was able to figure out some simple songs.I removed the pick guard because I really didn't like how it looked and it looks fine without it. The strings that come with it work fine and none snapped. Even if you end up not wanting to play it, you can always hang it somewhere because it looks nicer than I would have expected. The only problem I have is that the two G chords do not fit completely in the nut but i have heard that you can adjust it so it fits properly. I got this because I really enjoy the sound of a mandolin and the price is amazingly cheap. Also, another difficulty I had was that the tailpiece comes off easier than it goes back on. If you are interested in the mandolin definately get this to try it out.", "id": 202}, {"review": "they are nice sometimes but not as comfortable the rest of the time. they are cheap and do exactly what they are supposed to do.", "id": 617}, {"review": "The package arrived on time. This is the best capo around and works great. Does what it is supposed to do.", "id": 26}]
