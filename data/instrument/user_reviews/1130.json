[{"review": "I've been using one of these Kyser's for a good while now. I only have one so it usually stays with the mandolin but works just as well for my banjo. If you never used one, it's makes it MUCH easier to change keys although I usually only use it when I'm playing chords, when I solo I like to play with open strings and this makes it a breeze to pop off and put back on. With a little practice you'll be able to do it quickly without having the strings buzz.", "id": 43}, {"review": "I got my daughter a cheap fiddle here and the rosin SUCKED big time so we got this to use instead. Works well once you learn the trick of scuffing it up the first time you use it. I know everybody knows this already, but I've never played with a bow before, most all my instruments use pics or at least fingers.", "id": 78}, {"review": "I got one of these years ago as a starter mandolin. Do they sound as good as a 5K Gibson F5? Not hardly. Do they sound good for a 40-50 dollar Chinese built instrument out of the cheapest materials they could find? Actually, yeah, they do. This is one of those instruments where a case can cost as much or more then it does so I wouldn't worry about that. When you get it, the action is likely to be high and if you can't lower the bridge enough with the wheels it's easy enough to sand some off the bottom. Also, like most cheap instruments the strings that are on it are trash. Just throw them out or strangle the cat with them or something. Decent strings don't cost very much.Depending on what they sent you and how the labor force was the day it was built, you actually might have a piece of firewood or a pretty playable (after you fix the bridge and strings...) little instrument. The hardware isn't the best and the tuners suck but hey, if you're just starting out, tuning is part of the game.For $49.99 (and I've seen new ones 10 bucks less from time to time) it's worth the investment. You can spend more on dinner and a movie, and after you ate and watched the flick, it's gone. With the money spent here, you'll have something to keep you entertained until it falls apart and that will be much longer then one evening. My 7 year old boy owns mine now and he beats the hell out of it, so far, so good. It's been holding up well.BTW, if $49.99 breaks you, and you discover lessons cost more then your mandolin (been there), since you're here reading this, that means you're on the net and you can get plenty of starter lessons on youtube that will get you going, after that, you can find MANY good books/cds/dvds that will help you along even further and one day you'll get a better instrument. I'm actually thinking of getting another one to beat around on so I don't take the chance of ruining my good one while camping or whatever, and if I get cold and run out of wood, these are almost cheap enough to burn.One thing you may or may not know is the resale value on these. If you go to certain online classifieds (CL coughcoughcough) you'll notice people ask 50 bucks or MORE for these, sometimes over 100. USED. Same with pawnshops, and those people know what these cost new. This is one of the few cases where I'd buy new over used. If you decide to sell it and as long as it's not in pieces it'll still bring 20-30 bucks used so you won't be out much, but really, it's a good servicable instrument with a little work, but if you're lucky it might actually be set up right when you get it. Again though, not that big a deal to fix if it's not.Oh, as stated elsewhere these don't have trussrods. That's not bad in itself. You'd be surprised how many mandolins didn't have them years ago and alot of them are still around. Even from some big makers. If the neck warps in a year or two, no big deal, you got your moneys worth. Mines been kicking around for awhile, and the last year a 7 year old (6 at the time) has been beating on it and I can still pick it up, tune it and play it.", "id": 202}, {"review": "I got one of those for my next mandolin after my Johnson. I couldn't see spending 40 bucks for a case for a 50 dollar instrument, so I didn't. However, the next one cost a few hundred and I got one of these cases that has served me well. These are pretty soft inside and fit most A-styles pretty well. The hardware is decent but I wouldn't expect the hinges to last forever. They'll be easy enough to fix/replace when they fall off, so no worries there.If I had a $2500.00 Gibson/Weber/Whatever, I wouldn't buy this, I'd spend the money for a really nice case, but since I don't, I didn't. If you DO have an expensive instrument and want to cheap out, these really are decent little cases but you won't mistake it for a really expensive one, and that's fine.If it's still built like my case (never can tell these days...) it'll have a little storage compartment that will hold a bunch of pics, capo and a little tuner with no problem. Not big enough for a strap though with everything else in there.", "id": 752}, {"review": "As far as banjo strings go, these are a good bang for the buck, or were when I got them. D'Addario makes a pretty consistant product, I've used them on everything over the years, although I prefer certain brands for other things. Strings are cheap for the most part and easy to experiment with. These are also amazingly enough still made in the USA as well.If you buy a cheap instrument here, do yourself a favor and get a decent set of strings as chances are they'll be strung with trash if it's a lower end instrument from China. Even if you're starting out you should tell the difference right away.", "id": 255}, {"review": "I use this all the time for acoustic guitar/banjo/mandolin, as well as an autoharp and my daughter's fiddle. I'll be getting another one soon for her to keep in her fiddle case (wanted to teach her the basics of tuning by ear first or from another instrument like a piano or keyboard). This works well at a noisy jam and rarely gets confused. For my acoustic guitars it lets me easily tune to open G even if it's too noisy for me to hear it but it almost always stays in my mandolin case and gets used often for banjo as well. I've used it to tune my girlfriends autoharp and although the clip is stretched pretty wide it still does the job.Nobody really gets excited about tuners, but I've been playing a long time and nothing like this was around that I know of when I started out. If you wanted to tune and didn't have a 1/4\" input, good luck.", "id": 635}]
