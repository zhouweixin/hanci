Get something better that doesn't twist up an ravel into knots.", "id": 353}, {"review": "Hey it's a pick, it's 10 to a bag....I lost one already so now I have 9.  I my world that's good stuff.", "id": 574}, {"review": "The Mustang 1 was a great buy for another great Fender product.  It has more bells and whistles than I can mention but it's sophistication is lost on me.  I was looking for a clean crisp sound with little or no distortion and with the Mustang it seemed that's all I was getting.  Great little amp, just not for me.", "id": 718}, {"review": "Lots of juice, easy settings, very clean sound with all the horsepower you would need.  I haven't jacked it up all the way....I don't think the cat would appreciate that.  I get a little feedback every so often, occasionally it's a little overly sensitive to my volume control on the guitar,  but not enough to submarine this power packed amp.  How do you get that much noise out of an 8&#34; speaker?", "id": 734}]
