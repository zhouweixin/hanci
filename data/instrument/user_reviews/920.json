[{"review": "I've always used Ernie Ball strings. I've tried others &  always go back to Ernie Balls. They sound & feel great.  Bend 'em!", "id": 240}, {"review": "Easy to install, I used the guitars existing strap button screws.Straplocks came with black & white felt, that's a nice touch. I think black looks better with my guitar.", "id": 607}, {"review": "Wow! This little amp packs tons of tone & sound. Hundreds of presets that are going to take some time to explore fully. The  clean channels are really clean & the dirty channels are just plain nasty. 75 watts is enough power to blow your socks off. Lots of bang for the buck here.", "id": 620}, {"review": "The wall mount is very good, adjustable so it fits my guitars perfectly. The screws & anchors are poor. If you are not putting this into a stud, go get you some better anchors. Do not trust these to hold your guitar if mounted to drywall only.", "id": 779}, {"review": "The tuners arrived today. I had them shipped to my business address. It took me longer to get home from work than it took me to remove the stock tuners & replace them with these. Perfect fit & they look great.", "id": 387}]
