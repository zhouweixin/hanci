[{"review": "This versatile tool does what it says it does.  Pretty good quality. But, after purchasing, I realized that a tool like this isn't too necessary.  Some scissors and a little bit of elbow grease would accomplish the same tasks. But, it does make it a little easier and slightly more efficient.", "id": 94}, {"review": "Does what it is supposed to do. It is pretty good quality and durable too. Quick, simple and efficient.  I would definitely buy again. Highly recommended.", "id": 116}, {"review": "Nothing too crazy here. It holds your picks and sticks to your guitar. So far so good. Feels pretty durable, I'm sure it will last quite a while.", "id": 167}, {"review": "I am a beginner guitar player, so I don't have too much experience with different types of strings.  But, I can say that when compared to the stock strings of my Fender Acoustic guitar, these things are like night and day.  A much brighter sounds and a little easier on the fingers. Highly recommended.", "id": 295}, {"review": "WAY better than stock strings that I received with my Fender acoustic.  I am a beginner guitar player, but I was definitely able to hear a much brighter tone and it felt a little better on the fingers.", "id": 297}]
