[{"review": "this is as light as you want to go on a LP scale length.. about the same tension as 9s on a strat.so, don't want 9s, and 10s too tight then 9.5s it is.. nice strings", "id": 196}, {"review": "I have finally learned my lesson.I have purchased a number of these over the last year or two.. and previously had the same opinion as reviewers that say \"good for static applications\" as the cable conductors are prone to breakage, even along the length of the cable, not just at the connectors...But they are dirt cheap so i figured that was ok.But now, after recently buying and installing a cable from a mic in a sound booth to a digital mixer I checked it out and it seemed to work.A week later an acoustic duet came to record and the mic cable made the singer sound like she was singing behind a curtain.. yup..the cable.So by all means buy these on price, but when you get your items..please fully check them out.. a simple \"does it work yes/no\" is clearly not good enough, as i learned", "id": 465}, {"review": "Before I purchased the FBV I scoured the web to see how it works with the POD HD Desktop, and even the advanced users guide leaves you thinking..Anyway, I lucked out and found a used one going cheap, and after some time figured out exactly what you can and cannot do with the POD HD desktop & FBV Express II combo.1. First, in the setup screen do NOT enable the FBV Express. Yes, I know this sounds dumb, but internet scouring shows there is a bug that this is a workaround for...2. Read the FBV Express users guide and calibrate the pedal.. there is no need to d/l the FBV software for this.Now.. In the POD setup screens you have the option to either have the ABCD buttons as ABCD, or to be FS5-FS8. This behavior is mimicked by the 4 switches on the FBV.So.. In ABCD mode you can:a) Select preset A, B, C or D from the group you are currently in.b) Insert a volume FX and use volume pedal...EXP2c) Insert another FX enabled by toe switch, and controlled by pedal as EXP1d) tap temp (by tapping the currently selected preset..ie the pedal that is lit)e) enable the tuner (press/hold the current selected preset pedal)f) you have some basic control of the looper, but CANNOT enable it.3/10/14 EDIT :Looper control is flawed. You can record and go to overdub, but you cannot record then play/stop the loop.. you can stop from overdub but not start the loop. seemingly an acknowledged and unfixed bugNice enough, but if you are like me, switching presets is way way less useful than switching FX blocks on & off. incidentally you can combine blocks such that one pedal (say) turns OD on, and delay & chorus both off, or turn one amp on and one off (channel switching).. YAY!! you cry, that sounds like me so its a NO to ABCD and mode FS5-FS8 it is for me!..SO yup in FS5-8 mode you can do that, you cana) enable/disable 4 sets of block(s) using the four pedalsb) use volume and expression options as above (ie like volume or wah, overdrive level, delay FB etc)c) basic control of looper BUT cannot enable itEDIT 3/19/14 looper control flawed as stated abovec) enable the tuner?...oh sod it. nope you can'td) tap tempo?.. nope not that either.So in summary, the Express is better than nothing, but certainly does not provide hands free operation of the desktop.. the shortboard is worth the extra, or if you are reading this before buying the pod.. get the HD500x instead.", "id": 621}, {"review": "There really is nothing not to like about this pedal..a) 2 band eq plus voicing switch gives better tonal control than most,b) then drive goes from clean to solid overdrive..c) level control provide from -ve to high +ve boost.With drive set to 3pm and level at 2pm this gives a solid classic rock drive with a les paul and a blues junior.. really nice, roll back the gtr volume and it cleans to a crunch, roll back the drive and control from clean to crunch with the gtr volume.highly recommended..", "id": 749}, {"review": "I have checked this amp out twice, once with an orange ppc112 and once with the 8&#34; version, with both a Strat and a Les Paul, and I am very disappointed in this amp.Now admittedly, with the high output buckers on the les paul the pre-amp breaks up nicely and the tone is really sweet with the gain on 5-7, however the bottom line is that there is simply not enough clean headroom in this amp to produce any worthwhile volume with clean or mild crunch tones.So, without any volume with clean tones this amp becomes a one trick pony and hence so very very disappointing...Bottom line: unless you want full on distortion 100% of the time, you are better off with a clean amp and distortion pedal than this gutless amp.... if you are committed to Orange (and boy do they make some stunning amps) go check out the dark terror...", "id": 844}, {"review": "First of all its huge... no., like really huge....But finally you get over that, but seriously, its huge.The three presets are what sets this apart, but this could have been so very much better... why?.the midi clock sync implementation is flawed..A. The midi clock sync of delay operation is erratic and largely unreliable, particularly if you wish to change presets during a song or turn them on/off.B. To have a midi in, and not be able to midi sync/quantize the looper.. sigh...like really?.. This means you cant play with a drum machine, sampler, sequencer or play with anyone that does!So, while this offers some functionality above the Flashback in that this unit gives three preset delays (only one of which can be used at a time) and can be used as a basic looper (along with the delay defined by the knobs), The downside is a very large footprint.Therefore:BUY if you have the space and either need the three presets, or have neither a looper OR a delay.CONSIDER PASSING if the looper or midi functionality is seriously driving your decision... both are weak, after the fact, implementations", "id": 856}]
