About as sturdy as a tripod can be.  Exactly as advertised, no complaints from this user.", "id": 279}, {"review": "I always seem to have to re-tune with the spring loaded capo's.  Rarely have to re tune with this one.  Highly recommend.", "id": 304}, {"review": "These picks break way too easy.  I only play a few times a week but they dont seem to last long when playing for more than a few hours at the time.", "id": 332}, {"review": "Low strings do not get picked up very well but is ok if you are just strumming. For the price it is a good deal.", "id": 789}]
