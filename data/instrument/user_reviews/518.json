[{"review": "With all the other great reviews noted here, I decided to buy this guitar. Had a Rogue 12 string a few years ago and sold it as I was not that impressed with it. What a difference with the Epiphone.  The fit & finish speaks quality. Playabilty is very good with low action and good tone. Really is a great buy!", "id": 153}, {"review": "D'Addario is one of those manufactures that seem content with making a quality product for a reasonable price.  Their string selections compare very well to the pricer brands and I have yet to find a better buy.", "id": 274}, {"review": "I put these on my Dlx Players Strat but it wasn't a piece of cake. First problem... no instructions came with the package. Found a method done by another searching online. Served as a guide. Second, after removing the old Fender Tuners I noticed the new tuners didn't fit into the slots. This meant drilling out the holes by another 1/8 of an inch. Blue tape both sides as to prevent marring. Third, the new unit using a tightening center nut rather than screws to the headstock. There are also with two dimples. I used a ruler clamped to the headstock for keeping straight alignment and another clamp to press the dimples into the tock for drill bit placement. Then carefully drilled two holes per tuner. Take you time on all of this as not to damaged the finish on the headstock. These rest was simple. Install the tuners and tighten the nuts is now a breeze.  If you are not mechanically inclined then I strongly suggest you go to a Luthier as this is more than a simple replacement job. For the price you think they at least provide specs and some instructions.", "id": 560}, {"review": "The so called lower priced brother to the enormous Line 6 FBV Shortboard MKII pedal, while cut down still has a lot of the same features. Same quality build. Self powered when attached to my line 6 modeling amp (a real nice feature). One less power supply to hook up. Foot switches are easy to use. Built in tuner works great. The volume/wah pedal switching requires a little more effort than my old pedal but still does the job nicely with a firm forward press. Programming the pedal really allows you to fine tune four amp \"sounds\" and have them instantly available when you play (either at home or on stage).", "id": 621}, {"review": "Don't know why I didn't buy this years ago. I had a metal slide for years but always like a glass slide sound tone more. I like Dunlop products... they are always good quality. Price with Amazon Prime is a good buy.", "id": 456}, {"review": "Like another reviewer here, I too own a Fender G-Dec 30 (BTW: now going up for sale). The Spider Jam 75W specs are all out there so I won't repeat all that info but give you my users impressions instead. First I was fortunate enough to buy one for $300. (the same price as the Fender G-Dec 30), so it's an even simpler comparison for me.***The Line 6 Spider Jam 75W is a full head & shoulders taller and better than the G-Dec.***As just simply an amp it has more power & as good of sound. As for the rest, I'll take line 6's real drums sets and myriad of song backings over the Fender's midi/synthe tunes any day. The ability to save your custom tunes as JAM or WAV files internally or out to a larger SD card is a godsend and to me, the single biggest factor to own this amp over a G-Dec. (I use the max 2gb SD - note: it must be fat 16 formatted & is not HC.) The overdub layering is simply superb (though it's saved as mono). The XLR mike, 1/4\" plug aux & MP3 inputs allow a great flexibility for total song creation. Coupled with my Line 6 Variax guitar, I have been able to produce an amazing range of sounds and songs.The only criticisms I can muster are: 1) - The menu process is more difficult than the G-Dec but easy enough with hands-on experience. 2) - The chrome plastic knobs look somewhat cheap but work well enough. 3) - Line six really needs to update to an SDHC format so it can utilize larger than 2gb SD storage cards. I have experimented with using a 4GB non-HC SD card & though I was able to format it, I was not able to read / write to it. Line 6, please go to SDHC! I would also like to see an improvement to an \"incremented\" or notched amp model selector pot. As every once in a while it will jump from the A or B selection if not exact.", "id": 466}, {"review": "Simply the easiest, no hassle, no mess, way to clean your strings. I have used on all my guitars. It even fits my acoustic 12 string!Update: 1 year later and the string cleaner is going strong. Wash up in soap and water and let dry. I bought a 2nd one!", "id": 543}]
