[{"review": "Like other reviewer wrote previously, I received less picks than advertised (I received a total of 7 picks). I don't know if the people at customs \"borrowed\" some from me, but I find very strange that more than one person is having the same problem. Other than that, the picks are good, seem to be durable and produce a nice sound.", "id": 117}, {"review": "I bought this one as a way to save space in my overstuffed room. It looks really good, almost like an ornament. It sturdy and good quality. 5 stars.", "id": 166}, {"review": "This little item saves you the hassle to carry picks everywhere (wallet for example), and lets you securely carry many picks with you. I tought it would include at least a courtesy pair of picks, but it doesn't. I'm not complaining about it, but I think it would be a nice extra.Great buy!", "id": 167}, {"review": "Ernie Balls are nice strings, cheap, durable and produce a rich sound.

Also the price is right.", "id": 351}]
