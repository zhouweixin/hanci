[{"review": "This is an indispensable tool for all guitarists who constantly change strings. It is like the swiss army knife for string winding.", "id": 94}, {"review": "I love dunlop straps because I'm a tall guy and they're long enough for me not to look like an electric-guitar-playing-mariachi.", "id": 172}, {"review": "Well, this is a very simple accessory, but also a very convenient one. You can transport and organize your picks without making a mess inside the gig bag.", "id": 233}, {"review": "I bought this so I had no mess with cables on the board and I'm happy to say it works perfectly. It has everything you could ask for on a PedalBoard and not only works with Behringer, I have Suhr, Boss, Fender, Marshall, Dunlop and TC pedals and they fit very well. It comes with cables and configuration diagram ideas, not to mention it's a great advantage for taking it on the road without having to dissemble everything. Now my gear is always ready.", "id": 462}, {"review": "This one has an insane tonal range and a lot of cool features. The analog delay is just as great as the loop feature in this pedal.", "id": 511}, {"review": "I use these strings for my Telecasters and I have to say the tone is wonderful, beside they last for weeks without turning a different color because of the use. Very bright and really convenient for the looks of the guitar.", "id": 679}, {"review": "I know that pick choosing is a personal matter. I choose this specific model because the thickness and flexibility are perfect for me.", "id": 61}]
