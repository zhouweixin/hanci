[{"review": "We bought this Mic and a spare for our son's guitar amp set-up for his mixer. It seems to work fine, and comes with the Mic cord, We decided to go for the model with the on=off switch based on other reviews, and haven't yet been disappointed.", "id": 15}, {"review": "I replaced all the stock mounting screws that came with our sound rack cabinet with these, as they were nearly invisible with the black rails and mounting plates. The plastic washers also seem to protect the finishes better than metal washers on the equipment I mounted. Inexpensive, and worth it.", "id": 22}, {"review": "We bought this rack tray for our son's new sound rack. It is solid, and mounts easily to the front rails on the cabinet. It is a short shelf, so it only goes about half-way to the back of the rack cabinet. He uses it to hold his wireless receiver for his guitar amp, along with other miscellaneous things he keeps in the cabinet.", "id": 269}, {"review": "We bought this tester for our son to use for his band's equipment set-up.
