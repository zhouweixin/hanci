[{"review": "Alright strings. Nothing too spectacular about them.  I'm a fan of beefier lows and thinner highs but at the end of the day they're still slinks.", "id": 240}, {"review": "They are grovers.  They keep your guitar in tune with an iron fist lock.  I like the vintage look of these and they go great with my Gibson custom SG.  I have grovers on all but 1 of my guitars.", "id": 420}, {"review": "I thought I would not have a problem with the length of the strap but low and behold it was just a little too short.  I like my guitar hanging low and this strap doesn't cut it in that department.  Still, for the price I had to give it four stars.  You get a lot of high quality leather at a very good price, just wish it went a little longer.", "id": 656}, {"review": "A bit invasive and awkward.  I like another brand more because they feel a little more solid..  These feel a bit weak.", "id": 342}, {"review": "I've had it on my strat for a couple of weeks now and it is holding up quite nicely.  Color is good and as pictured and it doesn't seem to scratch easily.  Installed easily.... Only thing that was slightly upsetting is that I only received one screw.... They shorted me a gold screw... Luckily I had extra and this didn't bother me that much.", "id": 622}, {"review": "Not the greatest pedal..  Gives a really broken sound.  There is no mid way on this pedal either...  It seems its either all out fuzz assault or nothing.  The octave is a joke.  Having said all that I could see this pedal really shining with a punk sound where bar chords are in abundance.", "id": 836}]
