[{"review": "I've used these Elixir strings for years and I would never change.  These have an excellent tone and last four times as long as the others.", "id": 103}, {"review": "Like all of Dunlop products, this worked great.  It's real convenient on those rare occasions when you drop a pick in the middle of a performance.  I'm a Dunlop fan.", "id": 167}, {"review": "These are good picks and produce a great tone.  They're better than most picks at sticking to my sweaty fingers.", "id": 574}, {"review": "I love these Dunlop capos.  They are quick to put on, grip nicely, and above all they don't get in the way of your hand.  I bought 5 of them from Amazon because they were such a good price.", "id": 116}, {"review": "This neat little tuner has it all.  It is cheap to buy at Amazon but delivers outstanding results on tuning.  Unlike some of my tuners, this one picks up all the notes easily and gives a smooth and accurate reading.  I love the way it folds flat so I can get my instruments in the case with it still clamped on.  I keep one on my guitar and another on my fiddle at all times.  There is no more forgetting my tuner or misplacing it somewhere and losing it.  It's a must have.  It was only about $15 at Amazon and worth many times that amount.", "id": 635}]
