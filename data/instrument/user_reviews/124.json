[{"review": "it's kinda small for my hand but it works great! it's more easier to pick the string. This pack comes with 6 picks.", "id": 67}, {"review": "The pickup itself is very nice and pretty easy to use but the plastic thing wrapped around the cable really annoyed me. How the heck were you supposed to take those off without damaging the cable? Anyway, the pickup sounds very nice and i'm happy.", "id": 129}, {"review": "great case for my Epiphone Sheraton II! If you own a dot, sheraton, or a 335, you should buy this case! It comes with a key so you can lock it.", "id": 157}, {"review": "This cable is really good for the price! i have been using creepy cables that makes noises when plugged into the amp but this one keeps it quiet. Would like to purchase another one in the future. Buy it! it's worth it", "id": 168}, {"review": "I really like this foot controller because you don't have to reach to the amp all the time to change channels. I wish i had the big USB cable but i can't find it in Walmart. This paddle used to make this annoying clicking sound but it's gone now. Anyway, this thing is nice if you're too lazy to reach to the  amp to change channels. I think the product should have been around $70-80.", "id": 621}, {"review": "I think this guitar rest is pretty nice. It doesn't attach on the table very good though so  don't rely on this thing too much.", "id": 746}]
