[{"review": "So sexy with my SG. Great quality. I was going to get a pink furry one... this is better I think.", "id": 74}, {"review": "Real good variation from full out (RAT like) to not so much saturation. The treble and bass control make HUGE sound differences. Its plastic so dont jump on it! The 1 & 2 ( I dont use the boost but its cool) make it that much more versatile. You wont be sorry! Almost bought a Big Muff or another RAT but Im glad I spent WAY less money.", "id": 450}, {"review": "I've had this for 4 days and I'm so glad I bought it. Its basically a top end 2 second delay with whistles and bells you wouldn't even think they would be on there. I have had ALOT of delay pedals and this thing is limitless except for the 2 second loop capabilities.", "id": 509}, {"review": "Noisy as any compressor but after using it I don't wanna go back to not having one for my setup.", "id": 645}, {"review": "took longer than I wanted but im in cali and they are in jersey so... when I got the patches they were better quality than I expected. So It was cool.", "id": 847}, {"review": "This was EXACTLY what I needed this being the 3rd compressor I bought. I use it for vocals it drops bass a little is super quiet and has a mid range bump. So happy I got this (I got a used one and its in perfect condition so that was a bonus too) Behringer rules!", "id": 454}]
