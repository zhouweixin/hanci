[{"review": "The wire clipper and winder work O.K., but the pin puller is badly designed and doesn't slip under the ball of the pin in order to lift it out. Bad design by someone who doesn't use it to pull pins out of a bridge. I end up using a Jim Dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out. I've done it successfully for years.", "id": 94}, {"review": "My favorite string from back in the '60s when I had my own guitar shop. Great strings and the best packaging.", "id": 198}, {"review": "Easy, accurate and, best of all, it swivels to any position and stays upright for easy viewing. I've tried other brands and they don't swivel  correctly. And it's red! Very cool.", "id": 707}, {"review": "I've tried them all, and I like the Shubb the best. Easy to use, very tight and doesn't get in the way.", "id": 761}, {"review": "Easy, accurate and, best of all, it swivels to any position and stays upright for easy viewing.

Snark rotates to any position I want, but Intellitouch ends up being upside down. It works fine but it's inconvenient.", "id": 627}]
