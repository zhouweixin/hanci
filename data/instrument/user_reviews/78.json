[{"review": "I dont know why they are called big stubby. They are on the small side.  Way to thick for me.  They do sound good though and will last a long time.  I feel like I am playing with a nickle. I like the indentation. Helps the grip a lot. I should have paid more attention to the size and thickness. Still looking for the right picks for me.  If these were slimmer and a bit larger I would buy again.", "id": 66}, {"review": "They are half the size of a regular pick.  Bit too thick for me.  Sound nice. Will last forever. Wish I had sized them before I bought them.", "id": 68}, {"review": "I bought my first set of these strings about two years ago and havent looked back since.  Awesome feel, sound and price. Just the right thickness for playing all the classic rock and acoustic stuff that I do.  I know they are electric strings but they do sound nice when playing acoustically written songs on my Strat. One thing I notice with these is that they seem to sound new a lot longer than others I have tried. Thats nice.", "id": 259}, {"review": "They are tiny. About half the size of a regular pick. My fingers keep hitting the strings.  Nice grip area. Will last forever, sound great. A bit too thick for me.", "id": 686}, {"review": "So far I really like these. The thickness is about right for me which is sort of a light/medium. The grip is exceptional and they look sort of cool. I got six of them and will probably get more when these wear out. I doubt I will lose them.", "id": 503}]
