[{"review": "I have 7 of these stands for my 7 guitars. I have 4 classical guitars, 2 flamenco guitars and 1 acoustic steel string.  It's very durable and easy to set up and the guitars never tip over.  It's a really great, quality stand for the price.  They don't take up a lot of room and they're very light and portable if you want to take them with you to a gig or if you're traveling.  I highly recommend it.My guitar teacher suggested that I keep my guitar(s) out because he said that if I kept it/them in a visible, easily-accesible place that I would practice more, even if it was just a few minutes and he was absolutely right.  Instead of zipping them up and putting them away in their respective bags/cases after each practice session, I have them all out and displayed and I definitely practice and play more because as soon as I step into the room - there they are, I just pick any one of them up and start playing.  It was a simple tip that sounded like common sense but I hadn't realized that I always had the excuse that I didn't have time to practice -- but really the effort of getting the gig bag and unzipping it and taking out the guitar even though that seems like very little effort and doesn't take up a lot of time, for some reason kept me from practicing.  I guess out of sight, out of mind.  But now I keep my guitars out, and I also bought a music stand and I keep the music I'm working on and the stand out.  Yes, it takes up room and stuff but whatever gets me to practice more and play more is always very helpful.", "id": 92}, {"review": "Great foot rest, it's not flimsy.  But it's not light weight.  I put it in my guitar bag to carry with me and I definitely feel that it's there.  I like that it's adjustable to various heights.  I am short (5'1\") so I usually have it on the highest setting to prop up my left leg when I'm playing classical guitar to get the guitar at the right angle.  But I sometimes adjust it down when I switch it to my right leg and when I'm playing Flamenco and rather than rest the guitar between my legs like in the classical posture, I shift it over to my right leg.  I ended up getting a 2nd one so that I keep the one at the highest setting for when I'm playing classical, and then the other one at the lower setting for my Flamenco playing.  Great foot rest, I recommend it.", "id": 321}, {"review": "This was a precent decent product, I was able to use it to clean the strings on all my guitars and it worked well but the cloth that comes with it was really cheap so when you wipe down the strings, it starts to break down and leave a lot of lint behind and pieces of it get caught in the strings and frets.  Otherwise, besides that, the cleaner itself is great.  I just have to use another cloth to wipe it down afterwards and pick off the lint that gets caught in the strings and frets.", "id": 730}, {"review": "This is a great music stand, I like how it's adjustable in various ways to customize it to the exact position you need it in.  It's very sturdy and well built.  I don't ever worry that it'll tip over.  I love it.  I would recommend it.", "id": 155}, {"review": "This is a great tuner, I just wish that the clamp was a little bit wider since I mostly have classical guitars and the width of the headstocks can be a little thicker than steel string acoustics or electric guitars.  Other than that, works great I like using it.", "id": 707}]
