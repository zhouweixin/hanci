Nice quality pick.", "id": 67}, {"review": "I like D'Addario strings, but these did not impress me. They are not worth the extra cost, in my opinion.", "id": 130}, {"review": "I love these strings...they sound awesome on my acoustic. However, they do not last long, but that is the price you pay for a good sound. Not strings recommended for beginners, due to the bigger gauge.", "id": 199}, {"review": "I guess I did not expect much, since it was so cheap. Just know that you get what you pay for when you buy this. I got it for my son, and he wasn't impressed. Does not have good sound, but hey...if you're just wanting a toy, go for it.", "id": 589}, {"review": "I was expecting these to be like other dunlop picks I've had in the past, but these are rather cheap-feeling. Dislike.", "id": 680}]
