Works great and love the colorful display.", "id": 706}, {"review": "I can't say enough good about this amp. I have a Marshall jcm 800 2203 which is a great tube amp, but side by side this little amp really stacks up. First and foremost if you want a tube amp sound go buy a tube amp. But if you want something that is 90% close, well this is it. So versatile, light weight, and well constructed. Great Fender quality for a great price. Love all the presets. I have no problem with buzzing on any channel, clean or otherwise. Excellent guitar amp and I would highly recommend!!!!!! Love it!!!!!!", "id": 737}, {"review": "very happy. Holds my lies Paul and schechter guitars very well. Had a bit of a chemical smell when first opened.", "id": 813}, {"review": "Really great sounding harmonica. Beautiful sound and very well made! Very happy with this product and the price is incredible!", "id": 828}]
