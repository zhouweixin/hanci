[{"review": "I bought this to replace my son's previous guitar that had broken from hard use. From initial unboxing it is clear that this has been made to a much better standard. The wood looks beautiful. All the metal parts look sturdy and durable.It sounds good, although as my son is a beginner I cannot judge just how good.Note that there is no guitar cable.For now I am very happy with this purchase as it looks better made than I expected.", "id": 152}, {"review": "I bought this for my kids aged 6 & 8, they love it. However it has not proven to be kid-proof. The microphone cable is too fragile and they quickly broke the connectors on each end forcing me to buy another cable.When it's working they love singing and it sounds fairly good - no complaints about the sound quality.", "id": 690}, {"review": "I needed a new microphone cable due to my son destroying the last one so this decided to invest more in a higher quality cable. This GLS Mic cable is working well. The build quality appears good and should be much harder for my son to break.", "id": 701}, {"review": "This worked out of the box. I have two XLR misc, one keyboard, and a guitar connected and its very easy to balance the levels. There is no noise or other problem so far.Great for my family.looking to buy more soon.", "id": 368}, {"review": "I received the Fender cable exactly as shown in the picture.It is a thick cable with the ends of the jack and start of the cable enveloped in the white plastic strain relief.It looks great, was fairly cheap, and built to last.", "id": 803}]
