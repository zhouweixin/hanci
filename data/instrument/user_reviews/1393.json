[{"review": "I like these 9-42 Pure Nickel strings ... nice tone, work well on my Stratocaster with Fender locking tuners ... great combo, even with ghost bends, slides, and pounding with Drop D and Open G tuning.", "id": 88}, {"review": "Great highs and lows, but rough on the fingertips, and difficult doing barre chords, slides, and single string progressions. OK with more effort", "id": 97}, {"review": "These work much better than standard stamped trees. No problem with Ernie Ball strings going out of tune quickly.I did notice in Guitar Center, some of those spendy &#34;American Strats&#34; have the cheap stamped out trees, and non-locking tuners.", "id": 115}, {"review": "Good strings ..great for general guitar work, but I do prefer the EB rock n' roll strings for blues and rock playing.", "id": 227}, {"review": "I had trouble with strings going out of tune too often. Installed these Fender locking tuners, and voila !!!!!Amazing difference !!! Re-stringing is much faster now, and tuning is fast (no long loops around the tuning pegs) ,holds up much longer, rarely need to re-tune now, even after lots of bending and vibrato. ( I love the Ernie Ball Super Slinky 9-42 strings and Fender stainless steel 9-42 strings also).My opinion is every Strat benefits from these tuners, they should be standard on both the MIM's and American Strats.", "id": 387}]
