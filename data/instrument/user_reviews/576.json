[{"review": "Got three of these straps as we got tired of changing them whenever we needed one on a different guitar.  This is a great strap for the money.  They leather ends do not rub the guitar finish and the holes do not wear out as fast.  If you want to spend more money, you can and get a little better (leather extends higher on the strap on the more expensive ones -- nicer) but if you want something that is functional and looks good this is a good value.", "id": 74}, {"review": "I got this as it has a little different clamp handle design than another I bought earlier.  Like the black and it holds well.  This has been appropriated by my son who really likes it on his black guitar.  No problem as I bought one as a spare against emergency breakage.", "id": 603}, {"review": "This is very nice holder which holds my guitar in an accesible but safe from scratching place.  the mount screws were too low of quality to use though, I went and got my own mount screws (was able to use black ones that matched - better) as these did not work that well and I did not want to trust my expensive guitar to them.", "id": 779}, {"review": "This is a great Capo.  Clamps well and quickly, the clamp handle is easy to reach and is not going to easily break (aluminum, not plastic).  I like it and it was well under the price of others.", "id": 808}, {"review": "Great Capo.  Like the color.  Good clamp pressure and this design wraps around the back of the Guitar neck so it does not show.", "id": 839}]
