[{"review": "My experience with this little tuner has been perfect...It's extremely easy to see in a dark stage environment / it's dead quiet when activated / easy to understand when you are looking down at it while you're tuning / Takes up very little room on a pedal board / the cream on the coffee is that it's under a hundred bucks - that's crazy for the build quality - it's a little iron BRICKI highly recommend this little guy - Korg got it right on this one..!!!", "id": 504}, {"review": "It cannot be denied that the BOSS DD-7 is a versatile effective product...And it does EXACTLY what it claims to do, and does it well - but - I have a mixed relationship with this pedal...On one hand it does so many things with REVERSE / MODULATE / ANALOG settings as well as a half dozen other delay related settings it's a versatile tool - in fact it does everything you could ask a delay pedal to do except one thing... (one thing)In a live setting you have to set it and forget it (period)The four tiny fragile control knobs and the tiny black printed control panel are UN-USABLE (cannot be used) in a live dark stage environment...so when I'm at home putzing around on my guitar the BOSS DD-7 sits on my pedal board and gets used, but when I have a gig, it get's pulled from the board and the MXR Carbon Copy gets plugged into the slot and gets the nod in the performance category... The MXR Carbon Copy can be controlled by your foot and can be read from a standing position under any lighting conditions... so it gets used up there when the pressure is onThe BOSS DD-7 is a great pedal in a well lit practice environment ONLY - if you go live with it - good luck", "id": 511}, {"review": "These days on my pedal board I have several MXR Micro pedals...They have slowly earned their way on the board and eventually pushed some expensive boutique pedals into early retirementThe MXR Mirco Chorus is a perfect \"One Trick Pony\" it does one thing beautifully and simply - and that one thing is create a soft velvety chorus effect with good chime tones - when I activate the MXR Custom Comp pedal in conjunction with the MXR Micro Chorus I can easily copy the Andy Summers Police sound and a few other notable chorus stylesNote:It works great with distortion and with clean compressionI never have to bend over and adjust a bunch of NOBS in the dark - simply control the one speed NOB with my foot (on the fly quite simply)Presently I use these MXR products:The MXR Custom Comp = I highly recommend this very subtle very professional compression pedal (read any review of this pedal you'll see why)The MXR Micro Flanger = Easy, sounds amazing, never have to bend over and fiddle with it, does Jet airplane to subtle wavesThe MXR Micro Chours = Easy soft sounding with good chime - never have to bend over and fiddle with it - simple foot controlAnd the old standard (Ive had this since the 1980's) the MXR Phase 45 - simply the best phase pedal ever made - and I've tried them all", "id": 672}, {"review": "This is an A+ pedalIt's small and fits on a complex pedal board nicely - it does one thing and it does that one thing perfectly...The MXR Micro Flanger works great with distortion or just turn down the effect level and speed up the rotation and it works beautifully on clean passagesIf you want a Flanger to do any more than that you're just goofing off - mostly I need a subtle wash for flanger work and the MXR Micro is perfect for that", "id": 675}, {"review": "The MXR CSP202 or Dunlop Custom Comp is exactly what I'd been searching for...For years I played with only a crybaby and a phase 45 on the floor and everything else in a rack system. The rack systems had amazing studio quality compression and big complex delay boards, blah blah blah... but these days everything I have sits on a Furman SPB-8C Pedal Board (Highly recommended) and so I've been quietly searching for a serviceable foot pedal compressor, and that is harder to find than I had previously imagined... apparently they aren't easy to make..? I've been through 4 (coun't 'em four) foot pedal compressors and wasn't at all happy... an engineer mixer buddy said go try this pedal MXR CSP202 - so I did - and it's perfect...Benefits:1) It's easy to match your output gain on the pedal - so when you step on it - the pedal activates quality compression and NOT output volume suppression2) It's easy to understand right away - 3 seconds of looking at the pedal and you're done - 3 minutes of fooling around with it and you get it3) It's quiet but very effective and professional sounding4) It's solid and works exactly like very expensive rack compressionNegatives:1) It's expensive considering there are compression pedals for 1/2 this price2) It's got the 9 volt power supply connector on the wrong side of the input quarter inch jackOver all the thing is a Home Run - you can work around he poorly located 9 volt connection - you can wait a few weeks and save a few more dollars if you need to, but you can't fix a bad compression pedal if you buy the wrong one... I highly recommend this pedal, after a long process of searching and being disappointed I'm glad I found this pedal", "id": 671}]
