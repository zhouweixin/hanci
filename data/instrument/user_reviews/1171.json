[{"review": "alright I got tired of forking over 30 cent a pick at my local guitar store for instant gratification and decided to get some more online, and let me tell you, these picks get the job done. don't expect to be playing metal with these as they are on the soft side but work well for casual playing along with some heavy palm mutes and stuff like that. a few of the tips broke off but I think that's my fault for playing too hard :) Great picks, would recommend to anyone.", "id": 62}, {"review": "Alright, for the past 5 years I've been changing my strings with only the help of scissors to cut the unused portion of string, and let me tell you, doing this process on 5 guitars sucks! this tool Is AWESOME! It takes about 3-5 minutes to change strings now and it's well made and durable.the built in wire cutter was an awesome idea and works just fine. I'ts not perfect but neither am I So 5 stars, Would recommend to anyone.", "id": 94}, {"review": "These picks have proven their worth when I thrash them on my strings in an epic guitar solo or extreme metal I find myself playing all too often. Great picks, would buy 'em again.Bottom line:These guitar picks are outstanding.", "id": 573}, {"review": "I only use elixirs on my taylor now 1, because they last months on end while maintaining that new string zing, and 2 because they are soooooo smooth. It's like playing a silk guitar. Get these strings.", "id": 103}, {"review": "I only use elixirs on my taylor now 1, because they last months on end while maintaining that new string zing, and 2 because they are super smooth.
