[{"review": "This strap is very well made.  The leather is real thick and stiff which make is very unlikely to come off your guitar.  Very happy with this low cost strap.", "id": 285}, {"review": "Easy upgrade.  Fit with no problem, direct replacement for the stock tuners.  Make changing strings a whole lot easier.  Glad I did it.", "id": 387}, {"review": "When I bought this it wasn't the amp I wanted but because of budget and reviews I picked it.  I couldn't be happier.  This little amp really impressed me.  Add Fender Fuse software and its probably the best $99 I've spent in a while", "id": 718}, {"review": "I bought 2 of these and hung 2 fender strats on my wall.  Comes with all the mounting screws and anchors needed to mount properly.  Couldn't be happier with this product.", "id": 154}, {"review": "This would have been a nice slide if I could get it on my finger.  I'm borderline skinny and it still won't fit.  Save your money unless your under 10 years old.", "id": 340}]
