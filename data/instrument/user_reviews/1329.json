This is the second pick holder like this, that I have purchased (for different family members).", "id": 233}, {"review": "This stand is great!  It is solid, but light weight enought to move as needed.  The footprint is small & meets are needs well.", "id": 258}, {"review": "Works well with the AXL PG-515.  This is good quality for the price.  Snap is large and holds well; but is easy enough to unsnap when needed.  Its rare to need to remove this strap button because it slides out of the way, as needed.", "id": 877}, {"review": "Decent quality for the price.  Fits the acoustic guitar as intended and seems comfortable to the person it was purchased for.", "id": 470}]
