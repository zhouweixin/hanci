[{"review": "Fits the Behringer XM8500 perfectly. It actually dampens the sound giving better a more smoother sound and reducing harsh parts of vocals.", "id": 178}, {"review": "Bought this so my mommy can sing karaoke on YouTube. Also my cousins use it when practicing before using the condenser microphone before home studio recordings with my focusrite 2i2 interface. my cousin and I can perform live at house parties and events so as to entertain the crowd. So it was something that was necessary. and not waste of money or an unwanted item. Also i don't really have to use headphones because it is a dynamic microphone which reduces loop back when using skype or playing video games and talking to your friends, so now i can listen through my speakers.", "id": 213}, {"review": "This with my Behringer XM8500 is perfect.I like that it is branded with the planet waves logo on the connectors rather than plain XLR cables Which adds a sense of a quality look my gear. This goes directly into my Focusrite 2i2 interface and I'm planning on using this same cable with a condenser microphone I have yet to purchase.", "id": 283}, {"review": "I've been using Ableton for 4 years and it never crashes. I connected this interface with LIve 9 on windows 8.1 i set my default playback and recording device as &#34;Line Out Scarlett 2i2 USB &#34; and set it as my default device. It crashes every time  in Ableton but works well with listening to music either on my computer or on YouTube. Sometimes i hears pops and clicks after 5 minutes and have to reset the ASIO4ALL driver which is the same issue with my Audio Technica at2020 USB MIc.My computer is an AMD system and i have used my at2020(USB) on a Dell intel laptop but i never heard any pops and clicks even after using for hours so i am not sure whether this has to do with different hardware used in different computers or whatsoever but. i think it would be better to use this interface on and intel based system because through my experience.", "id": 801}, {"review": "I was expecting to be taken to heaven with these headphones.They are not all that impressive compared to the beats on ear headphones.But the would do just perfect for recording vocals but when it comes listening to music I say go for Dr.Dre Beats.If you want to know what the noise isolation feels like , just putting your hands on your ear.", "id": 458}]
