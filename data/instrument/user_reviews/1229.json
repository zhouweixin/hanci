[{"review": "The construction, fabric, color and padding are all A-1. This is a super bag! My precious uku will always be protected and look good too.", "id": 510}, {"review": "A well-designed strap that looks and works really nice. I'd say it's a little expensive. They should cut the price down by at least 1/3 and it would be a 5 star rating.", "id": 715}, {"review": "It's easy to use and is definitely needed for a new string musician. Good quality and ensures you are playing the chords correctly.", "id": 763}, {"review": "Beautifully finished. Everything about the construction of instrument is unbelieveable. Nice sound in the acoustic too. If this is an indicator of Indonesian made instruments, then all string instruments should be made there. Epiphone has outdone itself. I absolutely adore this instrument. I would love to have a Baritone Uku of this same design.", "id": 772}, {"review": "Aquila strings will never let you down. Highly recommended by all serious Ukulele players. Italian made, need I say more.", "id": 830}, {"review": "Awesome instrument. It stays in tune and is fun to play. The best $29 that I've spent in a long time. After a week, I'm already playing songs and I'm not a string player. Don't purchase this without buying a tuner. I bought the Snark SN-6 Uku tuner. It's awesome too.", "id": 840}, {"review": "This gig bag is assembled with quality fabric and awesome construction technique. Definitely far superior to any of the other gig bags that I'v ordered for tenor and baritone Uke in this price range.", "id": 845}]
