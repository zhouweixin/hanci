[{"review": "Had this strap for 20 years now and still going on strong. Just a simple well made product that does the job. Perfect for those who use the instrument very high on the chest. Looks classic too!", "id": 79}, {"review": "This bag works perfectly for the Digitech RP 1000 or pedals of the same size. I also use it for an older Digitech pedal and works like a charm. The construction seems to be sturdy and so far I' ve had no problems with the zippers. The side pocket is very convenient to store lines and plugs and the handles are very comfortable. Very good product.", "id": 165}, {"review": "beautiful tone and durable string, nice tension,  very good for bends, sweep picking and rakes.

Very versatile product for the seriousdedicated musician.", "id": 298}, {"review": "Picks are one of those items in which taste is 98% of what decides if it works for each or not. That being said I have to admit that these picks are very high quality. The design is really pragmatic and effective. I recently was introduced to these by a student of mine and I have to say for the first time in 15+ years I changed my picks.I used dunlop made with Lexan material and those I found to be perfect until these came along. Sometimes change is good! We just need to be open to it.", "id": 503}, {"review": "These feel very good but they wear off quite quickly, so not pick taping and easy with the struming. Also watch it if your alternate picking is with the pick almost at vertical.", "id": 574}, {"review": "great little time saver with all that is needed to restring in one compact device..It works well, pretty good buy.", "id": 94}, {"review": "The cleaner works as it should and the price is fair but what really did it for me is the cloth. Just feels right for the job..", "id": 194}]
