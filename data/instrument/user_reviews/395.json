[{"review": "these do a good job of isolating out the sound.  They work very well.  Would recommend it to other people", "id": 146}, {"review": "a little small for my hands, but the kids that take lessons from me loved them.  Cute idea.  Would like different holiday designs like this.", "id": 477}, {"review": "I keep ordering more of these picks.  I love the rubber grip and the mediums are just the right thickness for me.  Great product!", "id": 503}, {"review": "These stands are great for my lesson business.  I bought a couple of them and they are just the right height and weight.", "id": 696}, {"review": "Got these because I wanted some extra capos around.  They work fine and are a great price - they do seem to be a little hard to open (spring seems a little tight).  Good deal as back-up capos.", "id": 808}, {"review": "The Snark tuners are very accurate and the price on this could not be beat!  Great tuner.  I got about three of them!", "id": 811}, {"review": "These strings are just okay - they last about 4 months and then they start to fray a little bit.", "id": 295}, {"review": "These are nice, easy to use capos and the price was great.  I got several of them to use during my guitar class, when someone doesn't have a capo and needs one.", "id": 304}, {"review": "This is a nice, sturdy well made guitar stand.  It is great for gigs as it is small and travels lightly.", "id": 417}]
