[{"review": "We got this to save on trunk space when traveling with a guitar. As expected, it doesn't have the sound quality of a full-size instrument, but it sounds good for what it is. It seems to hold a tune well and my son enjoys playing it. The blue color is pretty, and we were pleased with the extras that accompanied the guitar (case, strap, etc). Other people have mentioned an odor on the case and strap. We did notice a scent, but it didn't bother anyone. A more odor-sensitive person might feel differently.", "id": 252}, {"review": "My eleven year old guitar player is very happy with this capo. It's easy for him to use and adjust.", "id": 304}, {"review": "My kid is happy with this strap for his guitar. He did have to widen the hole a bit in order to fit the strap over the peg on the bottom of his guitar, but ever since he got it on he's been very pleased. He especially likes the colors.", "id": 657}, {"review": "My eight year old finds this very easy to use on his violin. It seems to be accurate, and he is now capable of tuning his violin by himself.", "id": 762}, {"review": "My aunt the music teacher recommended this metronome and we really like it. It's been in heavy use (1+ hours per day) ever since we got it many months ago and I don't think we've even had to replace the batteries yet. It's got a good loud sound and is easy for my kids to adjust. We tried out some free metronome apps but the volume wasn't loud enough and my kids (though very adept at touch screens) found them tricky to adjust. This one is great.", "id": 390}]
