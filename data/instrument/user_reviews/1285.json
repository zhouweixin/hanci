[{"review": "Mixed my band's album with these headphones - the sound quality is impressive in all ranges, and they have a very respectable bass response. They're also great for drum practice, as they block out the loudness of the drums so I can hear my metronome perfectly. They're also awesome for live recording use as a monitor. I will definitely be purchasing several more of these in the future.", "id": 146}, {"review": "Sturdy mic clip on a budget. Mic fits snugly into the clip, allowing the rage to commence. Will purchase more as needed.", "id": 247}, {"review": "This is a really solid table mic stand, and you're not going to find a better price (I looked). The base is solid and heavy, and the actual stand is a sturdy metal tube. I liked the first one enough that I ordered a second. I should note, though, that it does not come with the pictured adapter for smaller mic clips, which I can imagine being disappointing even though it didn't affect me.", "id": 250}, {"review": "This shelf is exactly what I needed, at a reasonable price. I used this on my wall-mount 4U rack to hold my modem and router near my switch. As an added bonus, it has vent holes on the bottom, which not only allow for heat dissipation, but also make really convenient ziptie tie-down locations. I'll definitely be buying more of these.", "id": 269}, {"review": "These are pretty standard dynamic mics, and for what you pay the quality is good. I use them as room mics mainly, for which they perform admirably. I've only used them once for (backup) vocals, and the results were good. Would recommend these for folks on a budget. Also, the case is nice.", "id": 405}, {"review": "This is an absolute must-have item for any gigging drummer! Holds your drink, just like it says it will. What more can you ask for out of a drink holder? No more wasted beers getting kicked over during sets for this guy (at least not unintentionally). Pro.", "id": 530}]
