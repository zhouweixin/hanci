[{"review": "Very solid and I feel comfortable hanging my Taylor 414CE in this. Easy to remove the guitar and easy to put the guitar back in and always feels secure. Great item.", "id": 289}, {"review": "Pretty darn good in every way. Trim and easy to use. Solid construction. I recommend this capo without reservation. I like it and it is small.", "id": 304}, {"review": "Great deal for the price and very sturdily made. Easy to assemble and feels very solid. Way cheaper than I saw in Guitar Center. Im very pleased with this stand. I bought two.", "id": 517}, {"review": "Great deal for the price and very sturdily made. Easy to assemble and feels solid. Recommend this if you're tired of sitting on sofa and putting your neck in a bad way to see the music.", "id": 518}, {"review": "The Boss RC-3 Loop Pedal is great for playing guitar in a band, or with friends, but also a big help practicing. It comes with 10 pre-set rhythm tracks but the real fun is laying down your own chord sequences with your guitar and then being able to play lead guitar over that rhythm loop with just a quick stomp on the pedal. It makes practicing etc. a lot of fun and meaningful. I haven't figured out all the possibilities yet - and probably never will - but it is a cool pedal to have. Like all Boss pedals, it's as sturdy as a little truck.", "id": 739}, {"review": "I want to like this more but it's not as good as my other tuners. Tuning calibration on the meter seems skittering to me making it a little difficult and not. As easy as the little round ones from Snark. I like those better and they're cheaper.", "id": 785}]
