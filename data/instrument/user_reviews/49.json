[{"review": "A very good strap.", "id": 74}, {"review": "Arrive on time and as described.  I have yet to install but do not expect any surprises as have used these strings in the past.  I have read many of reviews on guitar strings as well as talked to many different guitarist.  Pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings.  What is interesting is they do not all agree on a specific type and/or brand.  So I reckon each has to find their own.  So far these strings have worked for me but am still experimenting to find &#34;the ones to love&#34;!", "id": 86}, {"review": "Arrived on time and as described.  The strap is well made and suspect it will be around for some time to come.  It is basic and not fancy.  It does the job, is comfortable and the price is right.  I have four of these Pro Tec straps having replaced all my old straps some of which date back a way too many years.  This one has the pick pocket which seemed like a neat idea.  So far forget to use it but that will come.", "id": 285}, {"review": "This is a great stand.  In the past I have been plagued with light flimsy stands so decided to go for something that appeared solid and well made.  This one serves the bill.  I am impressed with the construction and so far it has been very stable.  It is not as handy to haul around as some of the more flimsy ones but the proof is what it does when it is in use.  I use it regularly for events and so far am very pleased.", "id": 604}, {"review": "It arrived on time and was as described. Price was very reasonable.  It is easy to use with one hand and does the job.  Not sure what else can be said about a capo.  They either work or do not.  The other aspect is longevity and only use and  time will tell that.", "id": 839}]
