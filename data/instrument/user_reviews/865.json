[{"review": "When I first started setting up my little studio, I wanted something that didn't break the budget.  I tried a couple different combo pedal boards, (Digitech 500, Boss ME-70), but quickly realized I wasn't getting my sound and the money was quickly drying up.  With not much left, I tried a Tuna Melt as an example of Danelectro.  Who would think?  This thing is stunning in its ability to manufacture vintage tremolo sounds, as are most of this line of pedals.  I now own about 12-14 of these of all types, and have never been dissapointed save it's very hard to chain them without a lot of noise.Then I got into guitar building, and they all got put away.  Lately, I have been trying to make time to improve my playing skills, and joy of joys! I am rediscovering all these pedals and I absolutely love them.Forget the FAB series, they are not so hot.  Buy the old style as the Tuna Melt, or the big metal ones like the Dan Echo.  You will NOT be sorry!", "id": 24}, {"review": "I bought my Spyder Jam back in 2009, when it was fairly new.  I was simply blown away at the depth and available features on this amp.  I still am.  It's just possibly one of the best training and gigging tools for a guitarist out there.  You can play along with a drum track, with a drum AND rythmn track, and you get hundreds of presets and about 100 to make your own.  the Spyder pedals make it perfect, allowing you to turn on recording functions, drum and other functions, and also with the expression pedal, you get Wah and Volume.  The seperate tonal controls are great on this amp, and if you really dive deep into the menus, pitch shifting and timing are also available.  And with 24 minutes of looping time, that's just crazy for the price.I found it interesting that for a while, the Spyder IV 75 watter kind of dissapeared off the market in 2011 and part of 2012. It has basically the same presets of the Jam without the looper or drum and rythmn tracks, and was much less money.  I'd say it started to cut into Spyder Jam sales. I have noticed that the Spyder IV 75 watter is back now, but the Jam keeps right on going, with updates and endless support from Line 6.Even the eight year run of the Fender Cyber Twin, and Cyber Twin SE didn't offer the possibilities of the Spyder Jam, and the Cyber Twin was well over $1000 new. Yes, it has a tube preamp, and rewires itself to better simulate amps, but the Jam is SO much more in line with the budgets of up and coming guitarists. No contest, money-wise. And the Cyber-Twin is gone now.If you want an amp that you will keep for a long, long time, take a real hard look at the Spyder Jam.", "id": 466}, {"review": "First I bought a FM212DSP on the recommendation of a sales guy in a store. That was my mistake. I was looking for that \"Clean Fender Sound\" without paying the big bucks.Well, here it is friends, in all it's glory. Tons of headroom, so clean it can squeak if you want. Tele players should fall all over this thing as a practice amp.  Young players who are not heavy metal will absolutely love this for the price. It's LOUD, it's clean, and there is a fair amount of distortion in it, although you have to coax the distortion out of it.  Add a Danelectro Distortion pedal of some sort off Amazon for distortion and you're home. I own nine amps, including Fender, Crate, and Peavey tube models, and this is cleaner. If you play C&W;, look no further. If you fingerpick, this is your amp. Electrified banjo, mandolin or violin?  This is the amp!But, if you follow the darker side, keep looking...", "id": 559}, {"review": "I started two years ago with a 15 watt Spider III, then along with other amps, bought a Spider Jam. I thought they were all great.  Now they come out with Spider IV, and the difference in the sound is dramatic.  They are getting very, very close to tube sound.  So much so that for the lousy $299, compared to say $1000+ for 75 watts of tube, this is a real steal.Loaded with features, and hundreds of presets, it has something for everyone. The Pitch Shifter and 18 available manual settings just add to the fun. And it will work with either generation of FBV pedalboard. Says so right in the manual. The only difference I see is with the generation II pedal you get a USB port.Does it sound as creamy and smooth as my Peavey Delta Blues or Crate Palomino tube units?  No, there is still a little digital overlay around in there.  But most people who are looking for a great home based amp, or maybe a church or small gig amp, this is a WINNER and the price is just nuts.  Forget the Peavy Vyper, this is hands down much better and you don't have to sink another couple hundred in a pedal to get to all the presets like the Vyper.", "id": 620}, {"review": "I passed on all the Fender G-Dec units for years,(still glad I did), instead buying the Line 6 Spyder Jam and then a Line 6 Spyder IV. They are both great amps for sure, but for the money, Fender has really got this one right.  The clean tones on this are just great. The ability to modify with FUSE is an additional layer of gravy.  The amp is just about perfect for bedroom, studio or practice. I bet more than a few of these quietly show up in Nashville studios...I still love my Line 6 units, especially my Spyder Jam cause I can play along with tracks, and I love the accuracy of the models in the Line 6 Spyder IV.  But if you are in the market for a great practice amp, or an amp that will take you from super clean to vintage dirty for special effects on a demo, Fender hits the mark on this one. It's just ridiculous what is in this for $199.I compared this to a VOX Valve modeling amp, not even a contest. Against a Spyder IV, individual tastes will vary.Only complaint is the \"stacking\" of the six effects onto just two knobs. But that is a minor complaint. Most people don't use chorus and flange at the same time anyway.If you are in the market for a cheap, reliable modeling amp that is less cost than a Digitec RP500 pedal, you owe yourself to look at this thing. Right now, it is the biggest bang for the buck. I only wish I had bought the Mustang III, but it was not available yet when I purchased.", "id": 719}]
