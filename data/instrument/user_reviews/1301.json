[{"review": "This kit cleans strings body and conditions the fretboard. It's got everything you need for your high end guitar maintenance.", "id": 95}, {"review": "This is one of the quietest mixers I've ever used. The range of adjustability is excellent. 12 channels fill up quickly, but I've mixed 10 at a time and nearly no noise (at least I don't hear any).", "id": 369}, {"review": "This should be your first pedal. For 50 bucks you get every effect except distortion. No other pedal comes close to delivering more bang for the buck. It's clean, High Fidelity, and versatile as a swiss army knife.", "id": 430}, {"review": "Behringer pedals are the value leader in effects pedals. I have four of them and my latest is this compressor sustainer. It is very low noise and perfect for acoustic guitar and bass when leading music in a church setting. I've had more expensive pedals over the last 25 years of playing, but it's hard to beat the price features and quality of the Behringer pedals.", "id": 645}, {"review": "This is an even easier sting cleaner than the round tin cleaner that's been around. It's better because it cleans all 6 at once.", "id": 730}, {"review": "So many tones to choose from with the variable frequency Eq and a nice range of distortion makes this a killer deal.", "id": 434}]
