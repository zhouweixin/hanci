[{"review": "The Dunlop Guitar Fingerboard Kit arrived very quickly and was put to the test immediately.  I am pleased with the product.  It makes my guitar look new again.  I will definitly look into their other products.  Thanks to Amazon for the quick service.", "id": 96}, {"review": "I bought this Monster cable (12 feet, angled) and plugged it into my Create Amp.  WOW.  Clear and no static.  I can also wrap this monster up easily because it is not stiff, but very plyable.  Heavy duty and rugged, it should last forever.  Thinking about buying another one.  Great stuff.", "id": 126}, {"review": "What can you say about the best of the best.  I wouldn't use anything else on my guitar to get the best tonal quality from it.  These strings seem to last longer than the others I've used.  I highly recommend them.", "id": 156}, {"review": "This was the easiest way to hook up my pedals without having long wires all over the floor to trip on.  It's easy and convenient to use without losing quality and getting feedback loops.  I recommend it to all aspiring musicians.", "id": 181}, {"review": "This is a very handy item to have when you need to connect your guitar effects with power.  Its easy to install and keeps things simple.  No more extra messy cabling.  Glad I got it.  Thanks to Amazon for the quick delivery.", "id": 192}, {"review": "This simple tool helps protect my guitar from scratches when I'm changing strings, or just cleaning it up.  It's a foam cushion with a neck supporter.  It rolls up together into a small and convenient plastic tube for storage.  Well worth it.", "id": 571}]
