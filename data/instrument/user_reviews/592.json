[{"review": "I recently ordered a wide variety of picks to find the ones I liked best. These sounded different \"gel\" picks. I do not like them. Being see through distracts me. They are a little scratchy on the edges. Perhaps a more experienced guitar player would do fine with them but being at the stage where I am still looking at what I am doing - I just can't use them well.", "id": 69}, {"review": "I purchased this before I have ever changed a string. While waiting for it to come - I had to change one. Youtube videoed how to do it. This tool came and while it is nice and I will be sure to use it, It is not a MUST have. But I had wire snips from my jewelry kit available. Not everyone would have those. This will work great! It is sturdy and small.", "id": 94}, {"review": "Just exactly as stated, this is a small rubber piece to hook on your mic stand or guitar stand. Holds 6 picks. It is exactly what I wanted for a great price. Thanks!Editing this review to say that today I got a few thin picks and the \"thin\" picks do not hold in this. Mediums do great but the thin fall right out. Fine for me because I will just keep medium in it but just thought it might be helpful information for someone.", "id": 210}, {"review": "I just ordered three different guitar straps online. One for my daughter and at first a cheap one for myself. Then I found this and decided to get it. The $5 strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff. I got this and switched over. Ahhh this is a guitar strap! I see why you pay more. It is so soft and comfortable. It looks AMAZING! This is just a great product. I would highly recommend it to anyone and am proud to use it on my guitar. Thanks!", "id": 286}, {"review": "If you want a strap for $5 you can't expect the moon. I bought this along with 2 other straps of higher price. This is simple. I would not want to use it with a tank top on (or for guys on skin) because it is stiff and not \"comfy\" but it is practical and works well. The leather ends fit securely on to my guitar snaps. Both ends are the same - leather. (one of my straps has a string on the end - this kind does not - it is made for the snaps)No bells or whistles but I would recommend it for the price.", "id": 208}, {"review": "I have a few different brands of picks at home right now and these Planet Wave Picks are much nicer than the others. They are clean cut, smooth finish. Nice texture and looking. I reach for these first.Would and will buy again and recommend!", "id": 574}]
