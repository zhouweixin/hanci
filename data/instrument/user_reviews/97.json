[{"review": "Ok I replaced my Boss DD3 with this pedal because the boss was the only digital pedal I had left on my board and I wanted a complete analog board. This pedal is more subtle then the Boss but if you want some delay to fatten up those lead tones and retain the sound of your amp then look no further. MXR is by far better then Boss IMHO and I do love my DD3.", "id": 507}, {"review": "Acquired a 1993 strat without a trem and ordered this one. It fits perfect and even though I'm not a huge whammy user it's nice to have for that occasional vibrato.", "id": 558}, {"review": "Replaced my beloved Small clone chorus with this pedal and I'm glad I did. This is one lush pedal and it's all analog. This pedal also sounds great with gain.", "id": 767}, {"review": "I have a solid non weight relief Les Paul Traditional that is one heavy motha and these locks keep my fat girl nice and close to me. Like these better then the bulkier Dunlops.", "id": 386}, {"review": "Like many say, they do slip out easy so you need to keep that in mind, otherwise for the price and overall quality they are good cables.", "id": 578}]
