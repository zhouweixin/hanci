[{"review": "Happy to have Black connectors on an XLR cable that doesn't cost a ton.  I use these for a short run to my mixer from my Line 6 Pod. They work great. Not the greatest mic cable, but for the price they can't be beat.", "id": 169}, {"review": "Nice cables for the price. Nice to have a good name on them, and very useful for my band's mixer rack setup.", "id": 554}, {"review": "With how small pedals are getting the plug ends are bulky - even for a right angle - but they still sound good.", "id": 578}, {"review": "One was Dead on Arrival, the other one works like a champ. I like the old version more. These are a little tricky to mount but do track well, and are not obnoxious looking like the Snark tuners.", "id": 785}, {"review": "Best inexpensive right angle cables out there. I use these in my lesson room at the music store that I teach at. They will last forever if you take care of them.", "id": 168}, {"review": "In this price point - it's a good capo - if you know how to put one on and use it. I use it for lessons in case a kid steals it - so I'm not losing my G7 capo which was $40. Great capo.", "id": 304}]
