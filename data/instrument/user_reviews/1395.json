[{"review": "Nice to keep your mic nice and fresh. Plus it protects the head and gets rid of most of the noise while taking a breath. Decent value!", "id": 178}, {"review": "Excellent Product, it is well cushioned. I'm a typical overweight American. Great Sale Price!(Lucky Timing) All Black and fully Assembled! Doesn't get any easier than that... (Batman)", "id": 306}, {"review": "Price is Right for entry level. Using as a backup or on my mixer when using my higher quality short stand during recordings. The Mic mount was a PLUS, using it for one Karaoke \"Cheap Mics\" It is just pop-riveted on so a Bit LOOSE, but could improve with a little 2 part epoxy. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars! Still for the money a great buy...", "id": 708}, {"review": "Great value and the heavy base easily holds a professional mic or instrument mic.Great Price! Very Happy and shipped from Amazon perfectly with great packing.", "id": 224}, {"review": "Our second week and all is WELL! Nice and quiet. Using Speakon Cables (Mono) to each Speaker to Speaker for easy mixing. XLR to XLR from Mackie Mixer to PylePRO 1400 Watt amp. Great value for the Garage Band and recording to the computer for publishing on Web or using as a small GIG amp. Think I will get another one for the Stage Monitors. Might as well go ALL-IN!", "id": 496}, {"review": "Excellent value and you know what... It is identical in every way with the Retail store Product!
