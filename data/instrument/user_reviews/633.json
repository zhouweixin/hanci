It didn't sound very good, and I didn't know if it was the instrument or the strings. It was the strings, and I'm very glad I replaced them with these strings. They make my ukulele sound like it should, and it holds tuning pretty well. I'm very happy with the purchase.", "id": 203}, {"review": "Sturdy stand.", "id": 224}, {"review": "Works as expected. Clips onto pretty much any mic stand. The movable head is awesome.", "id": 697}, {"review": "Works as well as my friend's condenser mic that cost him three times as much. Great mic for the price.", "id": 594}, {"review": "It does a fantastic job. I've had it for almost a year now, still works as well as the first day. Perfect condition.", "id": 801}]
