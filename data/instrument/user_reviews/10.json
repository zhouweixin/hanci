[{"review": "I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed).", "id": 46}, {"review": "For $20 you can't go wrong. Its a lot of fun to use this little amp for practice and it goes anywhere.", "id": 303}, {"review": "Just starting out (again) playing guitar and ordered up this Classical. From the moment I took it out of the box I was impressed. The finish was really nice and the sound is awesome. Seems to stay in tune pretty well too. For under $300 you can't go wrong :-)", "id": 566}, {"review": "First off this costs extra because of the drum pads which are pretty much useless. You have to practically hit them with a hammer to get a response. The keyboard feel flimsy and they are indeed small and not very playable. There is no modulation wheel but you do get crappy unresponsive pads and cheap knobs. HATE the mini USB jack since those connections rarely last. For this price it is a 'Do Not Recommend' for me.", "id": 723}, {"review": "Inexpensive. Light weight yet sturdy while holding a guitar. Folds up and can easily be stored. Highly recommend this for the guitar player.", "id": 92}]
