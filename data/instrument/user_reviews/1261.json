[{"review": "This little cable gets used on my practice amp. I love the 90 degree connection. The overall quality seems good and I have had no problems.", "id": 419}, {"review": "I thought that a large would be perfect for my fat digits but this thing is big. It really doesn't affect play at all so it doesn't matter.", "id": 457}, {"review": "Works well and has good sound. I really enjoy all the versatility and amp sounds. The interface could be easier to use but for this price point one can't really complain.", "id": 600}, {"review": "I bought one of these at a music store like 2 years ago for 30 bucks. I was Impressed and used i to tune my guitar, bass and mandolin. Later I saw them for 8$ here on amazon and I bought 1 for myself 1 for a sister and another for my brother in law. These are a great deal. I can tune my electric bass without a pedal while the stage is really loud! It just uses vibration of the instrument.", "id": 706}, {"review": "This is just what I have been wanting for a while now. I have my Les Paul style guitar hanging right by my computer desk and that baby gets played a whole lot more than when it was in the case! A floor stand worked fine until I knocked it over one day:( Now it stays on the wall and away from danger but never out of reach!", "id": 779}, {"review": "I don't seem to drop these at all as compared to other picks I have used in the past that just seemed to slip....", "id": 61}, {"review": "I love being able to wind the strings, pull bridge pins and cut excess string with one tool! That frees up space in my hardshell case for other stuff. Seems solid and well built.", "id": 94}]
