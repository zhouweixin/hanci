[{"review": "it keeps the spit off the mic and looks cool when recording - it does great at keeping you mouth off the mic so you dont breath it out and fits great on the stands with easy clamp", "id": 46}, {"review": "i use this one a lot, its light weight and sturdy. it would be nice to have a counter weight for the long reaches, but can work around that detail. its well made", "id": 279}, {"review": "use to record my music, works great on vocals and instrument  together or separate. I like the deep tones and wide range of pick up. it grabs everything so you need to be careful of background, get it if you are even thinking, dont forget phantom power is needed !", "id": 371}, {"review": "it is entry level but only records one channel even though it is misleading with multiple inputs and outputs. It works as a beginner tool but only that. mono only.", "id": 639}, {"review": "cant go wrong with Dunlop pick, they last and don't break. end up losing them verses breaking. This .38 mm is a bit soft for my liking, will go a size thicker next time~", "id": 62}]
