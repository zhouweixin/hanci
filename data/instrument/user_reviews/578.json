[{"review": "When playing an electric &#34;bodyless&#34; violin, that hurts the collar bone.  You MUST have one of these.  It changed the whole way I play now.", "id": 637}, {"review": "This has got to be the best little tuner I've ever owned, and the cheapest too.  I have a $100 tuner that works nicely, but this one will handle any instrument you clip it to.  The SN-2 has the vibration pickup abitity that the SN-1 doesn't.  So I use it on all my instruments except my sitar as there's no place to clip it.  I highly recommend it.", "id": 707}, {"review": "Well, to date, these Snark tuners have got to be one of the best tuners I've ever run across.I highly recommend them, especially the ones with the built-in vibration sensor.", "id": 762}, {"review": "Can't play any instrument that has wood pegs without having a small bottle of Peg Drops.  Though I don't know why they don't put guitar type turners on violins, cellos and bases", "id": 359}, {"review": "The instructions could be written much better but I really like having one of these, in fact, I'll probably get a second one to tie to the first one so I can include more instruments.I guarantee, if you get one of these, you'll have a hard time leaving it alone. You can even work it into your live performances.", "id": 739}]
