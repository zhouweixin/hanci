[{"review": "good deal.", "id": 61}, {"review": "I've tried to like this pedal, I really have.  Maybe it's my signal chain (?)  My experience with the DigiTech series is that they suck the tone out from your guitar.  Sure, the OD is there, but it isn't worth losing your tone, is it?  Again, I reiterate maybe it's just me.  I have been messing around with signal chains for almost 3 decades now.  And the blue pedal isn't any different, either IMO.  Grunge was OK, but not my kind of style.", "id": 145}, {"review": "I like.  Fits well.", "id": 269}, {"review": "I didn't know how Pure nickel was different than other nickel wraps.  I was origianlly disappointed in the sound.", "id": 284}, {"review": "You won't get AC tone from this because your tone is subjective because you are running through another amp head.  but if you are a tone hound and bored with same sound of same amp, this is an excellent product lifting the voice of your Amp.  Sorta like buying a Wah, flanger or other product, this essentially will provide another venue to push out tone.  Problem is is that you won't replicate a Vox sound found on a classic rock album, because what you are producing is a unique sound.  I have yet to try this through a loop.", "id": 798}]
