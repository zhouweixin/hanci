[{"review": "I have been using this brand in several different gauges for many years and continueto do so. I get long life and very good clarity from D'Addarios.", "id": 156}, {"review": "I bought these for spares and also use on other amps so not to have to swap back and forth.I like the right angle plug end for guitar input and fits a std. Telecaster input jack great.The flexibility of the cable itself is another thing liked. These do not tangle in use androll up easily for storage. I have more expensive cables but rather use these.", "id": 168}, {"review": "This speaker has a very clear full range sound. I have it in a '63 Brown Deluxe and am very good with it. .In a way it reminds me a bit of a JBL with the smooth depth and clarity. If I want a little Ray Charles raspcan get it from the amp and not speaker with pick attack. Cool speaker and nice addition.", "id": 276}, {"review": "Nice bag with great features. It is slightly large for a Telecaster or Stratocaster but works fine for either.I actually swapped another bag, putting a Les Paul Jr in this one and a Tele in the Gibson bag as theGibson bag was a really tight fit for the LP JR. headstock.", "id": 311}, {"review": "Great unit for the price. It offer a lot of variations in echo delay types.It is sturdy enough for my use as not a stage piece. Even so would nothesitate to use that way. I can't say what battery life is as only use withan AC adapter. The EM600 sounds great using outputs to 2 differentamps. I drive mine sometimes with the Behringer A/B box using one ofthe 2 pre-amp gain controls or the Behringer Tube Amp Modeler.Only downside is the settings type control for echo delay types is a bithard to read without getting close to it especially in dim lighting.This isn't really a big deal though and often don't put the EM600 on the floor..", "id": 509}, {"review": "I can put 5 electric guitars in gig bags on this stand. It is solid and no problems with itafter 6 months use. Assembly was pretty easy and took little time.", "id": 769}]
