[{"review": "When you're just starting to purchase equipment and are on a budget look into Plant Waves line up of cables and such.They offer good middle of the road accessories. Even high end also. Check them out they carry OK equipment. These mic. cables are working really well for me. Highly recommended.", "id": 169}, {"review": "I do need a boom to keep the mic. stand away from my guitar when I'm playing and singing. This Posi-Lok Mini-Boom is a nice clean look and is very functional. On Stage has a well built unit here. I have ordered several! Highly recommended. Best price I have found is at Amazon.", "id": 291}, {"review": "I prefer woven cables for looks. They have a nice stage presence. Hosa has been a very reliable brand for my cables. I don't move around on stage so the 18 feet gives enough length to connect to my mixer. This cable is just a little stiffer than some I have but that's OK for me and I'm sure it will wear well if you move around on stage.", "id": 492}, {"review": "I'm not one to use picks much so when I do I prefer a light pick. I will be handing some of these to fellow guitar players because 25 will last a very long time. It is fun to share :-) For those needing a light pick go for these. Recommended.", "id": 574}, {"review": "I liked the features this recorder has BUT it is a chore to figure out how to use them all.It let me know that I am not a techy. For me not so easy to get beyond the basics. It does a nice clean job for the recording I have gotten done.", "id": 800}, {"review": "When just starting out one purchases equipment carefully. This capo is a good choice to start with because the quality is there. Even a professional would appreciate this capo.", "id": 808}, {"review": "A three star at best. I was not impressed with the finish or feel and I use a capo often. You can count on the price telling you of the quality of this product.", "id": 839}]
