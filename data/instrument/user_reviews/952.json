[{"review": "Great tool. I used to just coil the string ends at the adjustment keys, but this trims steel and nylon with ease. The quick slack take-up winder is nice also, but requires some adjustment in technique on classical guitars", "id": 94}, {"review": "Good value", "id": 274}, {"review": "Very good strap, but the pick pocket does not hold the picks securely. Especially when you take off the guitar for a break. Either a pocket closure or a spring loaded clip is needed", "id": 285}, {"review": "Good quick change capo, strong enough so far", "id": 808}, {"review": "great value", "id": 879}, {"review": "Great prce", "id": 349}]
