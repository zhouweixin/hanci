[{"review": "Easy to take apart, to put together, to store, and pretty stable when in use. Not the cheapest but worth the money.", "id": 258}, {"review": "The only problem is that the pick falls out of the pocket rather easy. Also the holes are a little hard to hook, in the beginning.", "id": 285}, {"review": "Not an expert at string picking by any means, but they do what I need them to do just fine.", "id": 574}, {"review": "It does the job. The only problem is that it sticks out a little to far down underneath the guitar neck thus impeding the fingers from taking the right position for some of the chords. You slide it up and away, you might loose pressure on strings and your guitar will make funny noises especially if you use hard strings. For the money, it does the job ok. It's a good one for beginers like myself.", "id": 603}, {"review": "The quality of it is above my expectations. The only thing I would've like different is the accessory box inside. They could've make it a little bigger. The box already fell down 4 times (I got small kids...) and nothing happened to it or the guitar. Great product, worth every penny.", "id": 864}]
