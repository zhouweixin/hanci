[{"review": "This tunners turned my normal cheap Squier, into a perfect Squier. My guitar now stays in tune better than my PRS and Epiphone.", "id": 387}, {"review": "It's amazing how it makes a electric guitar sound just like an electro-acoustic guitar. It's very useful when you don't want to carry two o three guitars, or when you can't buy an acoustic one. It's the best!", "id": 411}, {"review": "I tried another mini-amps but all sounds like toys. This is totally different, it's the real thing. Made of wood, very good looking and powerfull sound. The only thing I don't like is that it's hard to get clean tones from it, and with a Les Paul it's harder, beside that, it's perfect.", "id": 528}, {"review": "Actually they're not fender, they are Schaller, but that is really good!. Looks great in my Fender Squier. Highly recommended!", "id": 607}, {"review": "Very beatiful and good quality. Nothing bad to say, it's a Fender strap with the hard rock leather look! Highly recommended!", "id": 632}]
