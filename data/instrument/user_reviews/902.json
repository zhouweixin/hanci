[{"review": "Great sound, works just like a phaser should. I have had it for a couple months and dig the way it sounds. I use it with very little gain for sort of a clean funky guitar effect. Cool pedal, solid construction. Only thing is that it is big!! One other thing, it works better if you put it in front. I found that in the effects loop, it does not work so great.", "id": 377}, {"review": "This seems like a good product. It is working well for me and the chord is super long which is great. Too long is better than too short!!", "id": 428}, {"review": "The chorus effect is a little weak. I use it now to get sort of a leslie effect. Clean the effect is a little weak. The adjustment knobs don't seem to do much either.", "id": 487}, {"review": "Basic delay. I found the adjustment knobs made very little effect on the pedal. The other thing is it changes your guitar tone pretty drastically. Made my tone thin and tinny.", "id": 488}, {"review": "Cool pedal on a clean amp. I ran it into my dual gain amp and it just muddied the sound up. I am buying an old twin head that I want to try this on for a little vintage grit. I think it will work great for that.", "id": 757}]
