[{"review": "I use this for an instrument mic when sitting on stage. Rigid, easily adjustable and inexpensive. Lighter than a full boom.", "id": 291}, {"review": "This inexpensive capo works as advertised. It's the plastic version of the more expensive metal one but it works as advertised and is ideal for a light weight backup.", "id": 304}, {"review": "Perfect for remote recoding with up to 4 head sets. Clean amp and plenty of gain at  a great price.", "id": 376}, {"review": "I have a vintage banjo with exquisite inlay and this tuner is almost invisible. It doesn't obscure the pearl inlay and works well as a tuner.", "id": 785}, {"review": "Easily installed on my parlor guitar. The oval shape helps retain the strap and looks kewl. Installation is not rocket science.", "id": 786}, {"review": "Inexpensive and compares favorably with my more expensive tuners. Angle is not as adjustable as a snark but tuner works well.", "id": 846}, {"review": "I have already laid down 8 tracks and the process is effortless. Easy export to Protools for final mix but the internal tools are sufficient for a decent working demo.", "id": 873}]
