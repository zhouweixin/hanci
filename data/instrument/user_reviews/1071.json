[{"review": "This is a well assembled and packaged unit, designed to a price. So certain compromises have been necessary.Compromises such as a single-supply wall wart - partly an advantage to get the AC out of the amplifier itself - and very basic circuit, with inexpensive parts. The preamp supports only moving magnet cartridges, and has no provision for load adjustments or the like.On the other hand it works well, is packaged nicely, and serves its purpose for folks who are not audiophiles or fussy, but want a basic phono/RIAA amp for their turntable to connect to line inputs. Also, by avoiding the &ldquo;all-in-one&rdquo; tendency of units that include inexpensive D/A converters and such for USB output, this is almost certainly cleaner for the analog-only uses for which it is suited.The unit is also very &ldquo;hackable&rdquo; if you'd like to upgrade things like capacitors, resistors, or the opamps. Or use a nicer external power supply - the first thing I'd upgrade. Lastly, if you know the ideal capacitive load for your cartridge, and the capacitance of your phono cables, you can adjust the loading on the inputs accordingly.Recommended if your budget is limited.", "id": 363}, {"review": "Purchased for hanging two rock-band pseudo guitars. Works great for that and for uke. Would also be OK with guitars.The nature of the hardware compensates for different thickness at the nut end of instruments and so should hold almost any guitar-like instrument within reason. The packaging is very basic - you just get the product, with no fasteners or instructions.The hanger looks good, is heavily padded and so very unlikely to harm even delicate instruments. When solidly mounted, the hanger should be able to hold fairly heavy instruments - though I did not test that.For the cost these are a smoking deal. The alternatives I purchased for my music room & heavy bass guitars cost about 2x more and are not necessarily any better functionally.As mentioned there is no included hardware, but that is a non-issue as during install you may require installation to studs or with wall-board fasteners, depending on your situation and weight of your instrument. So just plan on visiting the hardware store if you don't already have these in your shop. I used wall-board hangers for one, direct screws into joist for the other, as it happens.", "id": 810}, {"review": "I actually have five of these for the various instruments, mostly bass guitars but also an acoustic and a solid-body electric.When mounted properly to studs - the only way I have mounted these - they are very, very solid. While in a nice package with instructions and hardware for wall board fasteners, I used longish brass wood screws to studs for appearance and strength. You do see the ends of the screws used after install is complete, and to me a brass screw looks great with this &#34;flat black&#34; model.The CC11 model -- this one -- works well with any kind of guitar including bass or acoustic. There are variants for other instruments, but a relatively wide range will be held securely by this unit. The yoke width is adjustable, and a combination of slope and two keeper rings prevent the instrument from coming off the holder.Recommended...but do consider you means of mounting carefully.", "id": 154}, {"review": "I like this almost as well as the Ernie Ball alternative I've been using for 20+ years with Shaler strap locks.These work the same bu the ends are styled a little differently. You may or may not love the details but they work just fine and to me are extremely comfortable.", "id": 208}, {"review": "It is strange how few fingerboard lubrication products there are that work well and don't build up, stink, or cost too much.I use this on all my household's guitars and basses. Works excellently, application from this bottle is good though occasionally needs a stir and shake to get more lubricant on the applicator.", "id": 234}, {"review": "If you want a little more &#34;meaty&#34; sound and feel on les pauls and similar guitars, this set is the ticket.Just slightly heavier feel but much more tone.As usual, after switching to heavier strings you may have to tighten your truss rod a bit to compensate for greater string tension.", "id": 284}, {"review": "You have to look very hard for anything to critique with this pedal; the only think I can think of is moderately high power consumption, so I suggest using the power supply rather than batteries.It is a joy to play almost any style with these, though I prefer jazz/blues sounds generally where the reverb is featured prominently as opposed to tons of distortion.Oh yes .. the clincher is this only costs a tad over 100 bucks. Very hard to find any alternatives that work as well in that price range.", "id": 748}, {"review": "Purchased to provide professional level I/O for recording from mixers etc.Works very well for that purpose; also and probably especially useful as location recorder with just a laptop and condenser microphone(s). The bus powered connection is as simple as it can possibly get, and the package is about the size of a fat paperback book. Inputs provide for microphone(phantom powered or not), instrument, balanced line on TRS, and balanced line on XLR connector.Tested with bass and guitar via instrument input also sounded very good indeed, and dead silent. Output of high quality material also sounds superb ... and compares well with other very high quality gear. Everything about this unit is a cut above the units from its competitors in this (crowded) price point.Though lacking lots of the I/O and routing options you get with more expensive units, this device, unlike most other products in this price range, has a quality feel to its enclosure, jacks and controls. Drives headphones, even inefficient ones, to satisfying levels cleanly.The input controls have a helpful feature wherein if you have set things too \"hot\" the color changes briefly to red -- helpful to bring your attention to your proper metering (in SW) to adjust your levels.Re computers and drivers: almost all the tests went well. On two laptops running Windows 7, installed the latest drivers from the focusrite web site and initial tests of playback and recording went great. One of these recorded perfectly also. The other, which has a core 2 duo processor (FWIW), had issues recording properly, and no matter which of the three possible usb drivers were installed, and I tried them all, this problem remained. So, for certain windows laptops, you may want to hang onto the receipt until you verify proper operation throughout. This issue is why four starts rather than five.On a happier note this interface \"instantly worked\", with absolutely no installation, on a linux desktop running ubuntu studio 12.04 \"precise\". So for linux users this may be a very attractive option.Lastly documentation and bundled software is \"light\"; this is fine if you know what you are doing but it would not hurt focusrite to provide a bit more substance in their user guide for novices connecting various types of gear - guidance re best practices etc.But this is a nit -- overall a superb value provided your computer interfaces happily.", "id": 801}]
