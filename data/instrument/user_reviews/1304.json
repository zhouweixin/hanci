[{"review": "Thought I'd try this but there's another brand that I prefer.  Needed to re-shift this capo a lot to get it to hold down strings evenly and not mute some.", "id": 116}, {"review": "Reviews described strap as &#34;soft&#34; and &#34;weathered&#34; which sounded good to me.  Actual description is a blasted &#34;design&#34; which is what you get.  Strap is quite stiff, but I'd say it's worth the price.  I would have preferred something different.", "id": 253}, {"review": "Really a nice upgrade...especially for the price.  They did stick up higher than the plastic pins, but I had read that they would.  At least I know that they fit snug.  Really look good!", "id": 392}, {"review": "Bought this stand after tripping over the three legged design.  Works great and base is out of your way.  Much less likely to catch your feet on as you move around.", "id": 515}, {"review": "I bought a classical guitar and then realized that I needed on of the around the neck with a sound hole hook type straps.  Bought one and due to past neck surgery, found that strap painful to wear after a few minutes.  Later saw this one and decided to try it.  Works perfect, really adjustable, and no pressure on my neck (since it doesn't go around your neck).  Great design!", "id": 824}]
