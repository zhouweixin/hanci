[{"review": "It cuts the string and winds the pegs much easier than one could do by hand. It is very solid and will last a long time.", "id": 94}, {"review": "Not very substantial. It began to tear on my guitar strings. I was hoping for something that would hold up to more uses.", "id": 184}, {"review": "Use very little of this. Rub it on and it then dries like wax then buff it off. It also lubes your strings. Good all around product.", "id": 348}, {"review": "You take the packs and put them in the sleeves. There is a double sleeve and a single sleeve. I have the double behind the neck of my guitar in its guitar case and the single behind the body. It has worked so far. It is very arid where I live and I want my fret board to be happy.", "id": 406}, {"review": "It is all preference. I prefer the cactus picks. These slide around in my finger to much right now. To each his own.", "id": 574}, {"review": "It is all preference. I bought a couple cactus picks and I like the fact they stick to my fingers better. These are slick and seem harder to keep track of.", "id": 575}, {"review": "Clamp it on end of the neck of your guitar. Pluck a string and it will indicate what it is. Turn the tuning knob to the desired spot and you are done. Takes 10 minutes to tune the guitar. Mine is electric. Works plugged in or unplugged.", "id": 762}, {"review": "The Capo is made of metal and works well. It does what it is suppose to do. I would buy this again.", "id": 809}, {"review": "I wanted P-90 pickups. They do make noise kind of like an old album. Once you start playing you don't notice it though. Other than that the guitar stays tuned and is a blast for a beginner like me to bang around on. It looks really good!", "id": 816}, {"review": "This houses your guitar and I have a couple humidipaks  in there because I live in a northern desert. Not many frills to this bag. It does the job.", "id": 51}, {"review": "I am a novice musician so perhaps my lack of experience in these items. Once you figure out how it goes together it is an excellent product. It holds your guitar up.", "id": 258}]
