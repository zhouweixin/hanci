[{"review": "Work very well, nice low profile, easy push button on and off but, it is true, not good for thick straps. And the Gold Tone ones discolor easy with minimal use.", "id": 44}, {"review": "I've read the revues and some don't do them justice. These fit very well, do the job they're supposed to do and if you know you have a hardwood guitar, just use a cordless drill to attach them, make sure you place the clutch at a low level in order not to strip the wood and have a secure fit.", "id": 513}, {"review": "This baby does what it says it does at a very reasonable price. One does have to find the cable loops that one needs to eliminate humming & noise, for one doesn't know which in or output is actually making the interference but, once you've established that, it's all good baby!!!", "id": 615}, {"review": "A good solid case. As for size, it's designed for the narrower Fender style body electric guitars. It could have better padding for instrument protection, ( compared to similar product from other makes.) Will do the job of good protection.", "id": 864}, {"review": "Very handy, has multiple benefits that are very useful. I just had to loosen the screw that holds the winder a bit and lubricated it with silicone spray and done deal!", "id": 94}, {"review": "Good quality and very comfortable for the material and with of belt, no matter how heavy your axe is. Can't go wrong with this one.", "id": 659}]
