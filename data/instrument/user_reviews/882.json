[{"review": "I've had this little amplifier for a few weeks and I couldn't ask for a better practice amp. It's amazing how loud it gets in an otherwise quiet room, but it'll get drowned out pretty quickly when you add competing sounds. It's rugged and portable, and it's fun to play around with some of the effects. The fact that it runs on batteries is a huge plus.", "id": 48}, {"review": "After reading the reviews, I expected the leather to be a tougher than it is. It's soft without being limp. There's no break-in time required. I bought this for my tele and it looks ans feels great. I like to keep a pre-adjusted strap in each guitar case, and I'm planning to buy another one of these for my Martin.", "id": 253}, {"review": "This is a nifty little tuner. It's accurate and is fast to turn yellow if you're off by even the slightest degree. I just leave it on my telecaster. It's a little deeper than I thought it would be; it actually lifted the tele up a little when placed in the case. But after a few weeks, the foam conformed and the neck now rests on the case support. The ratchet is a little gimmicky, but once it's set, it can be easy slid off and on the headstock.This little tuner is made to be left on one guitar. If you want one that you can move from instrument to instrument, then get a Snark.", "id": 822}, {"review": "These are durable, but I get some noise from the cables. It's barely audible, but it's distracting nonetheless.", "id": 876}, {"review": "Nothing special here. If you don't like doing the shoelace thing with your acoustic guitar strap, and you don't want to bore a hole in the heel, then this is a nice compromise. There are slits on both ends of the leather, which means you can reverse the button if you don't want the logo on the front of the guitar neck/headstock. You could even flip it inside-out and have the soft leather side exposed. I subtracted a star because I think the button should be made out of metal instead of plastic.", "id": 568}]
