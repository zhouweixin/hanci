[{"review": "This is a very versatile tuner!  I use it all the time to check my instruments, and keep things sounding good.  Highly recommend this product.", "id": 707}, {"review": "I thought these would give me more volume and a better feel for stumming my uke.  I don't use them much at all, preferring palin hand strumming to what these deliver.", "id": 775}, {"review": "I bought this holder and then mounted it on a stand I built of cherry and maple for my uke.  It does the job.  It could be just a little stiffer in its adjustment, but it stays where I put it, so no complaints.", "id": 779}, {"review": "These strings are great.  They are very mellow sounding and I like them a lot.  This is what came on my uke, and I wanted to make sure I hade replacements.  I got both hi and lo G sets.", "id": 829}, {"review": "This stand is small, compact, and sturdy.  It holds my tenor uke just fine, and when folded, fits into the pocket of my uke case.  It's perfect to take along to a gig or practice, and therefore have a safe place to put the uke down.", "id": 881}, {"review": "I bought this stand because I needed support for larger songbooks that my metal fold-up could not provide.  I really, really like it. Others in my music groups that have seen it have also gone out and ordered one.  It assembles quickly and easily, and folds up into a nice package for transport.  Every once in a while I have to tighten the lock cams, but that is no issue.  It is very sturdy and holds big music books very well.", "id": 357}, {"review": "I wan't sure I would like this thing when I ordered it, but it was cheap enough to try.  I don't like using it as much as I thought I would, but that's just me.  The device works as advertised.  Over a long period of use, I think it might leave a mark on the sound hole, even though the hook is padded.", "id": 824}]
