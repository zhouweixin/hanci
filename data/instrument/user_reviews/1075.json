Leak air badly. Easier learning bagpipes than these things.Save your money and get some harps that actually work.Decent case though.", "id": 293}, {"review": "Bought this because of all the great reviews, ButThis doesn't work, just like the last Beringer product I bought. Will I ever learn? Very disappointing.UPDATE- Now working; got my mate an Aussie genius to have a look.Found pedal wasn't engaging when pushed down.Took plastic cover off and pressed black button with his pinky and light came on; sheer genius.Worked fine with cover off; then replaced cover with new bit of rubber. And it still works.Amazing sound actuallyStill not sold on Berhinger though", "id": 381}, {"review": "As usual an excellent Zoom product.Adds to my playing. Just love this thing.
