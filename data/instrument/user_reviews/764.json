[{"review": "The .6 MM pick has just the right amount of flexibility without flapping around like thinner picks. And the dunlop nylon standard is my first choice for mountain dulcimer playing. I know people use yogurt containers, credit cards, bird feathers and even coffee stirrers for picks, but for me, the consistency of the Dunlop pick can't be beaten. And the price is right, too!", "id": 64}, {"review": "This compact humidifier is easily filled with an included plastic syringe.  If you don't over-fill, it will not drip, and you can simply place it in your case instead of the usual sponge.", "id": 71}, {"review": "The J74's are sort of the default string that mandolin dealers put on their instruments.  They are bright and brassy when new, and give a decent punch to the sound.  However because they are bronze, they can discolor your fingers and they tarnish pretty quickly, especially in the summer when your fingers are sweatier.  Also, since they are round-wound, they are harder to fret than a flat-wound string and harder to shift up and down.  But the people who like them change them often, like once in 30 days or so, or whenever they play a gig, to get that nice bright brassy punch for when they are new.  This is because they get to a point where you have to work harder just to get the same volume, being less elastic, and less lively.  One thing is sure, that the J74's are loud and zingy, and that's why dealers put them on their mandolins.  Some folks move to the heavier J75's to get even louder and fatter woof on their chops.  The J74's are brighter and more aggressive than flatwound strings and cut through when you're in ensemble work.  Just make sure to change them often to get the best performance.", "id": 338}, {"review": "Finally, a product that is as simple to use as a point-and-shoot camera.  Literally, I opened the box, put in two batteries, the memory card, read the quick-start guide, put the Zoom on the included stand, and got out my mandolin and started recording.  The sound quality is great, and you can play it back directly on the Zoom by plugging in some head-buds (included).  The control buttons operate like a DVD remote, with a \"menu\" button, using the \"fast-forward\" and \"reverse\" to scroll through entries, and the \"record\" button as the \"set\".For someone who is not well-versed in audio terminology, gain, sampling rates, mics, pre-post amps, levels whatever, I just set it to medium gain, watched to make sure the lines don't go too far up, and was recording away in two steps.  Push \"record\" to test the gain level, and push \"record\" again, (red light stays on), to record, and push \"record\" to stop.  The file is saved, and then you can push play/pause to listen back.  Deleting files is a few extra steps but if you know how to program a VCR you can use this puppy.It is also handy, portable and easy to take places.  I will take it to record jam sessions, music lessons, and practice to evaluate my playing, and instrument comparisons.  The sound quality is great, and I could hear how resonant and clear my mandolin is.  I wish my playing was as great since it recorded pick noise, finger slide noise, and other assorted twangs and twings.  It records both in WAV (huge files) and mp3 (compressed), with various quality levels to choose from.  You can easily connect it to a computer (Windows/Mac) with the included USB cable.The only thing missing is a remote.  Since you have to push the button on the recorder, you have to move to it to activate/deactivate it.  Also picks up noise from your movements.  But for the price $199, it's a real gem.I always look for the one thing in a product that is a surprise, doesn't cost a lot and delights the customer.  On this one, it is the included wind sock, a tiny foam cap that you can slip on top of the unit to screen the wind for outdoors recording.  Cool!", "id": 463}, {"review": "Jade rosin gives a extra grippiness to the bow.  It hardly generates any dust, and gives the bow that extra grab.  The only problem is that the effect wears off quickly.  I use it in combination with Motrya Gold.", "id": 636}]
