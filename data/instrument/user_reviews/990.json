[{"review": "this is a beautiful guitar...the finish is amazing...and the tone is very clear...if you can't afford several hundreds or thousand for a les paul...this is a fun and very good guitar for the money...has 6 strings,,,from e to e...and if you know the g chord you will have lot's of fun...the volume control goes to 11 ,if you want to kick it up a notch...(only kidding)", "id": 31}, {"review": "this case is the best i've ever had...very plush on the inside, and hard construction on outside is very strong...the handle extreamly soft to the touch...i guess all my other cases just don't measure up to this one...it even locks...if your guitar fits...but this for the quality!!!", "id": 50}, {"review": "WOW,if you need a guitar cable this is it...it's metal on the tips and long and black in the body (like a long snake with shiny ends) no, it works just fine and just long enough for my playing...if you have a guitar and amp you will need this...even without a guitar and an amp it's still fun to have!!!&#60;&#60;&#60; be warned this review may not help you...so go on to the next, if you need too&#62;&#62;&#62;", "id": 168}, {"review": "i like this very much,because i can't love a polypropylene guitar strap,,,if you have a neck and a guitar,then you are in business!!! (you really can't ask more than that from a strap) it feels fine,and if you have a bedazzler you can write your name on it...me, not so much,i'll just leave it hang!!!", "id": 208}, {"review": "i like it as the stars say...great for around the house playing,but  lately i noticed it does cut out on me...when you strum it shuts down somrtimes,i am not sure if it is the battery or it just does not like the song i am playing...when you turn it back on it usally works fine...some other people have made the same discovery also...but for $20...i'm going to live with it,,has a belt clip if you want to look really silly playing...i just glued it to my pelvis!!!", "id": 605}, {"review": "1,540 people like it,who am i to disagree...it works well but i wish i had discovered the gibson app on my iphone before i bought...but for the price it does work a lot better...never clip it to any body parts only on you guitar (don't ask) only kidding!!!", "id": 706}]
