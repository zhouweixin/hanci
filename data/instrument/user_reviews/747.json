[{"review": "These cables are a little thin compared to hosa and GLS. They picked up a little interference from other equipment as well. Guessing they are lacking some shielding.", "id": 16}, {"review": "I bought these mics to fit a shure mic and a GLS mic and it doesn't fit either.  A little too small.", "id": 179}, {"review": "If you are a mobile DJ that needs to put a mic clip on a mic stand for each event then you should get one of these.  It saves me 5 minutes per event (setup and break down) just by not having to put the mic clip on and off each event.", "id": 271}, {"review": "I bought this because it was cheap and figured it can't be that bad. I was surprised that it was good. I had this and a shure mic with a professional singer and they couldn't tell the difference.", "id": 425}, {"review": "These bags are large.  I didn't realize they would hold large tripod stands.  My other bags were a lot smaller and sometimes the tripods would stick out the top.  It would have been nice if there was two pockets so two tripods wouldn't touch each other but this still works great.", "id": 552}, {"review": "These mic stands worked perfectly.  The fold down pretty small so you could fit a couple of them in most travel bags.  Easy to adjust.", "id": 585}]
