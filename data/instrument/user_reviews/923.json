[{"review": "Excellent compact guitar stand. Folds so small that it easily fits in guitar case or gear bag. Not as stable as some stands but for the size and price, can't be beat. Thanks to Amazon for offering such a good product.", "id": 91}, {"review": "These pedal cables are of superior quality at a reasonable price. Well-designed and reliable, I highly recommend these. Thanks to Amazon for offering this great product.", "id": 181}, {"review": "Purchased this to replace a Behringer pedal because the Behringer introduced a \"swishing\" sound. This pedal has good choices for reverb types and is relatively noiseless. Good product and got good price here on Amazon.", "id": 185}, {"review": "Highly recommend this adapter because it is transformerless and has high current capacity for powering numerous guitar effect pedals. It is highly reliable and introduces no hum nor noise. Also, it is designed so that it will plug into a power strip without covering adjacent receptacles. Thanks to Amazon for offering this great product.", "id": 191}, {"review": "High-quality cable for expanding the capability of the One-Spot or Godlyke 9V power adapter. Distance between plugs more than adequate for most pedal boards.", "id": 192}, {"review": "Excellent pedal tuner which is easy to read on light or dark stages and mutes the signal while tuning. Well-designed and rugged construction. I believe that it is a much better value than other major brands which cost at least 50% more. One-button operation makes it simple to operate.", "id": 504}, {"review": "This cable expands the capability of the One-Spot or Godlyke 9V adapter. The quality is very good and the length between plugs is more than adequate for most pedal boards.", "id": 486}]
