A good quality cable at a very good price.", "id": 5}, {"review": "I have two Behringer mixers and both exceed my expectations.  Small yet clean and versatile.  Great for gigging remote events.  A great value for the money.", "id": 367}, {"review": "You cannot go wrong with this mixer.  VERY clean sound, very versatile.  Very reliable.  I have been using these on the road and in my home studio without any trouble at all.  Very much Recommended!", "id": 368}, {"review": "Great price but very fragile.  I'm a 30 year radio pro always careful about my cables.  The end separated from the cable - not very good quality, would not buy this brand again.", "id": 444}, {"review": "Works well with my PC notebook and my MacBook Pro.  Sounds good.  Amazing for the price.  Good buy. Can'd go wrong.", "id": 569}, {"review": "Nice mic - good quality, no problems and have used this heavy over the past year.  Sounds identical to my Shure SM58, but MUCH less.", "id": 213}]
