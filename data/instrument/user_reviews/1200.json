[{"review": "I typically use planet waves cables but tried these and there just as great. Never an issue. No loss of tone. Never breaks or fails. Quality product for a good price.", "id": 11}, {"review": "Once I switched to these cables I never use anything else now. Great connection sounds good and no issues at all.", "id": 168}, {"review": "This stand gets a lot of use from me and holds up great. I'm going to be switching to a 7 stand rack soon for all my basses but I will still keep this around because it holds up well. Love the all black look as well.", "id": 258}, {"review": "Mic Stands can be a hassle sometimes. This is not one of those. Always works. Adjusts easy. Holds in Place. Great all black look. Built to last and great price as well.", "id": 515}, {"review": "Well built.Not plastic or cheaply constructed like some pedals out.Has a good selection tones and voicing knobs really does a lot to effect sound.Simple to use. Great variety of uses for it. I like the layout of controls as well.Only bad point for me is the location of the adapter input it's on the right side,I'd prefer it to be on the top end like my other pedals. Other then that nothing I'd change. Loyal Joyo pedal user. They've got a great product for the price point.", "id": 797}]
