[{"review": "works great, stays out of the way... cant ask for much more than that. (and expect to get it) the price was half of what i was locally.", "id": 43}, {"review": "put it in my Fender dreadnaught and only wish i have held out for the the next step up in quality with the mic as well...  Love it to death, had it pertinently installed and love the sound and the versatility.  the built in volume knob it a GREAT tough.  I could go on, but there are reviews on you tube that will do a better Job than here.", "id": 56}, {"review": "not the greatest little pick up, for the price im more than happy with its performance.  put it through a highr quality mixer and there are no problems, run it through a practice amp and it comes off a bit tinny.  I wont fit in the sound hole to I clip it to the head stock and it works surprisingly well.  Cant beat it for the price.", "id": 759}, {"review": "(star rating based on price) great for home use, but dragging it on the road i dont know how long it would last.", "id": 841}, {"review": "Ive used this on Guitars acoustic and electric, Ukuleles, Banjos, Banjo Ukeleles, Violins, and mandolins.  no issues... well except that sometimes it rattles (quietly), it doesn't effect how it works but i hate a rattling guitar.  That Just means i take it off most of the time after i tune.  That's not a bad thing as it keeps me from playing out with the Tuner clipped to the guitar the whole time, and I hate how that looks anyway.  I love the little thing.  My only complaint is that (like all other clip on tuners that i've had) it wont turn itself off if i leave it on accidentally, and will then wear out the battery.", "id": 811}]
