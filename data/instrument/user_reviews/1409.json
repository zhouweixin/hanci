Well, you get what you pay for - leather looking paper wouldn't hold guitar. So, I gave it a chance and bough this on and it seems like this strap holding well. Ends is actually made from leather and fit buttons tightly. It still not too wide to play for few hours - but for that you have to buy $30+ one. So, this one works well for the price.", "id": 285}, {"review": "we have to many musical instruments and this is amazing little tuner.
