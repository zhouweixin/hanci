[{"review": "They work good.  Way to stiff and small for me though.  Great attack but holding onto it is the problem.  The slick finish makes it kinda hard to hold onto and the small amount of pick that shows makes strumming difficult without hitting your finger on the strings.  I imagine it would work great for lead players but I'm a rhythm player.", "id": 68}, {"review": "Last forever and easy to hold onto.  Not much more to say but there really isnt much more that needs to be said.  My favorite picks.", "id": 83}, {"review": "I bought this to put the new strings on my guitar but the shipping info said it wouldnt be here for a few more days.  I restrung my guitar without it and it showed up in the mail a few hours later.  I can say its built much better than I thought it would be.  Feels like its built to last.", "id": 94}, {"review": "Its ok.  It does what it says, but if youre using more than one other pedal you get a loud white noise in the background.", "id": 380}, {"review": "The most diverse pedal I own.  You can play everything from Pink Floyd to Parkway Drive with just a few tweaks.", "id": 381}, {"review": "Quick and accurate.  I also like to use the bypass mode as a standby switch for changing guitars.  Doesnt register notes well with both pickups engaged though.", "id": 443}, {"review": "I payed the $11 for this just because the tuner I have was so slow to respond I needed something new.  The response time on this is like half a second and it's super simple to use.  Keep in mind that the Snark website sells this tuner for $40 so 1/4 the cost here is definitely worth it.", "id": 811}]
