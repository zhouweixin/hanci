[{"review": "I love the idea that you don't need a pocket in your strap or elsewhere to store your pick. Further it will not add something else to find/loose in my pants pocket.", "id": 29}, {"review": "My fiancee tried it out and kept one of the three that was bought. So I guess she loves it as that is the only pick I've now seen her use. [She has been playing for over 35yrs]", "id": 243}, {"review": "I really like the idea of a &#34;Pick&#34; pocket in the strap. In fact I like it so well.... that when I replace the strap on my other guitar I'll make sure it also has the same type of strap.", "id": 285}, {"review": "I have never played a string instrument... and it looks like I'll be able to get the hang of this very quickly. Only problem is the strings. Sting one ... play's &#34;dead&#34; meaning it will not stay in-tune. Not sure if the knot is slipping or it is the string type that is the problem. Have another set of strings [better quality] and will try that set soon.", "id": 766}, {"review": "I am worried that I will damage my instruments if they are left standing around. This will allow me to show off and protect them.", "id": 779}, {"review": "This is so darn cool!! It shows which string you are tuning and exactly when you are in tune!! And it works on so many instruments!!", "id": 846}, {"review": "Forgot it came with a strap to secure the guitar to the stand...... Doubt I'll use the strap.. but then again I probably will try  to use it that way.", "id": 258}]
