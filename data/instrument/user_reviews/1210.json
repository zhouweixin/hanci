[{"review": "These have been my favorite picks, for decades now. They grip very well, and last forever, and they're a tiny bit more muted than other, more &#34;plasticky&#34; picks.", "id": 62}, {"review": "These are nice,and this was easily the best price around. These are made in Japan, and I believe they're made for Fender by Gotoh, so they're good quality. But I was annoyed that they ( the bushings) didn't fit the \"standard,vintage-sized\" .340\" holes in my All-parts neck ( they're a little large).So be aware of that.", "id": 114}, {"review": "I've almost exclusively used Earnie Balls and D'addarios since I was a kid,and have always been satisfied. I've taken advantage of Amazon deals on both strings lately. The D'addarios are excellent strings, and this price on the 10-pack was unbeaten,anywhere.", "id": 156}, {"review": "Absolutely perfect. Some other reviewer complained about theirs being blemished, but I'm guessing they just didn;t know to pull off the protective layer. Mine was shiny-new, and was an absolute perfect fit on my Mexi-Strat. The price was the best,anywhere,and with free shipping, I couldn't be happier.", "id": 217}, {"review": "This is the 2nd set of these Fender parts I've ordered. $15,delivered is about the cheapest price,anywhere. They look great and fit perfectly. Can't go wrong.", "id": 222}, {"review": "Nearly all of the reviews I read on these were very positive, and I concur. These are very nice, solid tuners, especially for the price.They do add a little noticable weight to the headstock, but it's not a problem.", "id": 387}, {"review": "I was going to get the plate with the big \"F\" on it, but I read complaints that it was very thin, so I kept looking. I took a chance and got this one, and it was a good call. This one is very thick and solid, like it's supposed to be.Great product, great price.", "id": 527}]
