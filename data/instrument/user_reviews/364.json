[{"review": "if you go very high with the boost in frequencies, you will get noise in significant quantities. too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation. Pay the extra money and get something quiet. Others complained about this and they were right. If you want to experiment with equalization, its good and cheap. Some complained about each band boosting others. This is more of a user problem than manufacturing. If you want to isolate a frequency range, boost that range and then cut the ones before and after it and you'll get a narrow range. In this respect, its like an MXR 6 band.", "id": 380}, {"review": "Let me be upfront. I often use my electric guitar unplugged. When I am plugged in, I don't move around a lot. So this cord does not get a good frequent use and abusing. But no hum or noise and seems solid. It was very affordable. Can't say how it would perform if used live and in performance all the time, but for the price, I can not complain at all. I suspect it will always work good for me due to its light usage.", "id": 419}, {"review": "I once dreamed of something like this around 1979 when Guitar Player magazine had a plan to build such a thing. It has 9 volt battery adapaters so that if you have a few MXR pedals from 1979, they will work on this setup. for those who have 9 volt power adapters of the more modern kind, they fit these, too. I got all sorts of stuff plugged in; mini amp, flanger (has AC), equalizer, compressor, fuzz, wah. Love my gizmos. Say good bye to batteries. This is very affordable, too, given the high number of effects it will supply. I could find nothing better on the market for the price and features.", "id": 428}, {"review": "To me, this is a pick to pick notes and leads. It does not seem like a chord strumming pick as much. I use light  or medium regular size picks for strumming. I really like the fit/feel of this plucking pick. Smaller, but stays in your fingers and glides fast over the strings. You might balk at the price but I do not regret it in the least. Some nice picking with this pick. I don't play a lot so I figured 6 ought to last me quite a while. I have an old thick stone pick with is an interesting experience, too. But the Dunlop is better to me.", "id": 686}, {"review": "I say this one is more between a Fender Medium and heavy. But it has the star for grip and that is super. Hard not to like. Get some!", "id": 549}]
