[{"review": "Good cable, as good as any expensive brand. Thick, a bit stiff and seems to be shielded. No complaints at all.", "id": 6}, {"review": "Dunlop is not the best strap lock system because it's a pain to switch which way the lock is pointing and people complain that the button is easy to unhook while playing. I can see the merits of screw on locks, what with the ease of switching the locks, but these work fine for me.", "id": 44}, {"review": "Using the stubby spoiled me for all other picks. You simply play faster, no matter what level you are. Alternate picking speeds increase because there is no more flat-pick drag. Now I only use flat picks for acoustic play when I want to hear the crunch. 24 picks in a pack, is an insane bargain. You pay twice as much in a store.", "id": 66}, {"review": "String trees are a great inexpensive way to upgrade your standard tele or strat with accessories found on more expensive or custom shop instruments.

Unbeatable for acoustic, especially since so many acoustics are neck heavy. I would recommend this to anyone. &#8203;", "id": 174}, {"review": "This Levy's Jacquard strap is well made and comfortable. It was much cheaper here than any other place on-line or at a brick and mortar. Arrived quite quickly, but a tracking number would've been nice.

Perfect.", "id": 593}, {"review": "Tuner works well with acoustic but not so great when your electric is not plugged in. Seem like it needs more resonant vibration to register the sound. Sometimes you just need to whack the tuner a bit, and it's okay. I also have the NS Micro, and that's a better tuner.", "id": 706}]
