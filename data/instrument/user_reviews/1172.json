[{"review": "I won't rant about a string winder..  They aren't that technical of an item but I do like the string cutter.  I do almost prefer the pin puller on the cheaper units but I am not going to be that picky..  This unit works just fine and I am sure that I will lose it before It breaks..", "id": 94}, {"review": "I bought this when I was doing sound for a party where we had acoustic musicians that wanted to be mic'd.  It really came in handy to mic a guitar and a mandolin..  I will be buying more of these!", "id": 143}, {"review": "I play in small tight places..  Sometimes, People dance right in front of us..  I actually bought one of these  for my partner because for some reason, he would put his stand high and only use 1/3 of his boom to hold his microphone..  the rest of his boom arm stuck out into the crowd and because it was so tight, drunk dancers would bump into the boom part of the stand knock his microphone into his teeth..  Despite me telling him that he should just adjust his boom differently, he wouldn't and would continue to get annoyed by the drunk dancers.When I saw this, I thought it would make a nice christmas gift..  He does use it in the one place that he has problems but only here for some reason..I bought one for myself as well and I do like it..  The plastic piece that holds the extruding part to the other side of the boom does not stay in though..  It comes apart quite easily..  My only complaint..What I do love is that the teeth on the boom angle that connects to the stand holds the boom and it doesn't slip down at all!  I personally love that because I have had Boom arms that &#34;Go Limp&#34; and their is nothing more annoying!!", "id": 291}, {"review": "This little stand serves so many purposes for me..At home, it is a keyboard stand and even a stand to put my pedalboard on when I want to test out different pedal configurations.At my gig, It holds my presonus mixer, A laptop and all of my wireless transmitters and receivers..  It is so versatile because it can be narrow or wide AND Short or Tall..As well, I have the onstage connector that will allow you to connect a mic boom to it..  I plan on using this one day to hold my Ableton Live machine as well as a small 2 octave keyboard and I will use the mic boom arm at that point!  Even as a keyboard stand, I like it because I can put pedals underneath it..  WIth it fully extended to &#34;Long&#34; mode, I can fit both my pedal train pro and mini underneath it..  Of course, that is 54 solid inches of stage front though..  Which is indeed a lot for the small places I fit into with my duo..", "id": 358}, {"review": "Onstage makes well thought parts for mounting things..  I use these all of the time for small cameras that are stationary..  I put them on a mic stand and it takes much less room than a full blow tripod..  They can't hold a heavy camera very well but a small one they will hold just fine..", "id": 548}]
