[{"review": "I've had my wah pedal for a number of years now. What I can say is that it has put up with a lot of use, no problem with the pedal itself, mechanically. However, the cheap rubber feet were the first victims of perhaps taking a few cheaper short cuts on producing the product. That is to say, the rubber feet began to come off in no time. If you mount it on a pedal board, you will probably remove those feet and this won't be a problem. Also, the power supply that comes with it does a stellar job of powering the pedal. If you are like me though and place it in a pedal board where a unified power source makes sense and must use a different power cable, at least on my unit, the jack is not fitting properly leading to some serious shorts. Those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat. What I have learned is that when using a different power supply to be sure the power jack is push ALL THE WAY in, otherwaise, ZAP. Other than those two issues, the power issue really no fault of Dunlop's if you use the supplied power cable, its been a great pedal. A classic that will surely live on.", "id": 41}, {"review": "If you are looking for a sustain pedal, this is it. Built solid, feels like it could withstand a good beating, which is good since my teen is using it. Not complaints, just works and is reasonably priced.", "id": 251}, {"review": "Versus the Godlyke, I'd say this is the better purchase. Though the Godlyke product claims 2000mA of power (2amps), this is slighlty less at 1.7mA (1700mA or 1.7amps). Anyway, if your drawing that much juice using your pedal board, you may want to re-consider what you are using. The product itself is plastic, but seems solid, I believe it will hold up to repeated use no problem. Being plastic though, you do have to be careful not to drop it or have it stepped on or rolled over, etc. I do like the fact that it does have a heavier gauge wire than the Godlyke product and seems slimmer so it will fit more readily into '1 spot' as advertised. The heavier wire means that when someone rolls in their 4x12 cab your power supply cable will have a higher chance of survival. The extender that comes with is good, seems about as generic in length and space between connections as you can get. I only wish it came with two of them. I am using a Pedaltrain Pro board and at 32.9 inches, it will require a pair of the extensions to get to all the pedals. The combo pack also includes some other adapters for those odd pedals that refuse to conform and use 1/8\" power connections, some 9 volt adapters for pedals with out any external power. One thing I have not checked yet is the actual output of the supply. A lot of companies think that if their voltage is 'close' to 9 volts, thats good enough. The reality is that this is an indication of poor quality control and lack of intrest in producing a quality product. You will find some higher end devices specifically warn NOT to use anything higher than 9 volts so 9.6 volts isn't 'close enough'. Anyway, while I have not checked the output of the adapter yet, I did fire it up on all the pedals I could power with the one extension that came with and everything worked nice and quiet. It is amazing how having a good quality power source can help eliminate some buzz and other 'noise' from your signal chain. I'd buy this again and in fact I may buy another just as a back up. It is a tad pricey at thirty bucks... feels more like a twenty five dollar item given the all plastic construction but, all in all, a good buy over the competition.", "id": 428}, {"review": "Pretty straight forward bench. I was surprised at how comfy it was at the price. Good height, comfortable, Id buy it again, no questions asked.", "id": 464}, {"review": "..is all I can say. I got the unit, opened up the softcase and pulled out the nice black powder coated aluminum pedal board and...WOW there is a lot of space on this thing. Do I think the price is fair for a piece of welded aluminum and what is basically a re-branded 'Gator' nylon bag. No. Its over priced considering thats all you get plus some plastic ties and velcro. However, when I factor in the laziness of not wanting to build my own board, suddenly one hundred fifty bucks seems like a decent trade. I was a littel disappointed to see the cheap-o rubber feet, my guess is they will be missing in about 6 months but, I have learned to fix those. Specifically the product is solid as welded aluminum should be and the soft case feels rugged...we'll see. Again, my only gripe is with the price considering there is no other mounting system other than velcro, at least that comes with it, and no intergrated power supply. However, if you need a lot of pedal space (read the dimensions!) and the heft of welded aluminum, this may be the last pedal board you buy. Did I mention this thing is freggin' huge? Minus one star for a little price gouging...", "id": 489}, {"review": "Works well, pretty straight forward. A little over priced for what it is, but, sure beats having to purchase another complete stand.", "id": 548}, {"review": "This is a really good patch cable. Fits into different brand of pedals well and is really flexible with out feeling like its cheap. I was able to weave it in and out of the Pedaltrain Pro no problem. In fact I've order 4 more sets of these for the rest of my pedals. Highly recommended.", "id": 578}, {"review": "I purchased a BUNCH of Planet Waves Classic cables for my new pedal board. The cable is a little fat at the connector for pedal board use so if you have a tight fit this is not the cable for you. However, I am very pleased to find the cable itself is quite flexible. My complaint, like other reviews I read, is that the end doesn't seem to fit snug on some connections. For me these cables fit very well with the MXR pedals, Dunlop wah and the Ibanez pedal. The Boss pedals however, were hit or miss. Can't say for sure if this is Plant Waves design problem or Boss, but it does seem odd it seems to be mostly the Boss pedals. I have a couple EHX pedals also, one side is snug the other loose. Anyway, for the money, I think you will be happy with the Planet Waves cable, nice moulded ends with a good flexible cable.", "id": 662}]
