[{"review": "I have these on my Jazz Bass, my guitar player has another brand. We were playing a HUGE downtown street gig in Altanta and were throwing T shirts to the crowd. Bending down, picking them up, then throwing. My guitar player had a different lock system, and his $1000 Les Paul fell to the stage, completely knocking it out of tune. Mine stayed locked perfectly...", "id": 44}, {"review": "Makes the strings nice and easy to fly over. No buildup, or residue on your fingers either. I like this stuff.", "id": 173}, {"review": "Nothing sounds as bright as these strings. I've tried many, and these are the best by far. I know, cause I play'em geetar real good-like.", "id": 204}, {"review": "It's a decent unit, but stopped working completely after about 6 months. Tried everything I could, but it's gone. I would not recommend this pedal.", "id": 378}, {"review": "I use this often to record my band's gigs. Now if they would make one that will hold a PAR 38 can so I can turn my extra mic stands into single can lighting racks!", "id": 548}, {"review": "The plastic piece that screws the wire into the end was made of VERY thin plastic, and cracked in two within a week of light use. I guess I can redo it with electrical tape to make it work, but I have many Whirlwind cables that have lasted me 15+ years. I expected more from this manufacturer, but I guess the quality is not the same as it used to be.", "id": 554}, {"review": "It stopped working after 2 gigs. I'm not sure why, but it is very frustrating. I guess you get what you pay for here.", "id": 606}, {"review": "Great product! Easy to use and I was able to shield my entire Jazz Bass. It would have been nice to get a little more of it though, since this was JUST enough.", "id": 694}]
