[{"review": "I have acoutic guitar that never felt comfortable to me. This little device changed that by allowing me to use just about any standard strap and attaching it to the neck for better balance. And its inexpensive.", "id": 174}, {"review": "This is not my first Planet Waves locking strap. They have never failed. Though the selection of colors and widths are very, very limited, it will keep your guitar secure if you can live with those limitations. Obviously if you have your heart on a certain strap other than these then go ahead and purchase straplocks. But for me these work just fine. Highly recommended.", "id": 208}, {"review": "These really are direct replacements for the PRS SE line. Only the machine heads are somewhat smaller. A great product.", "id": 275}, {"review": "This jewel does give a Vox AC tone (depending how its used). For direct recording it does. If used with an amp, maybe. But however you use it, it is sweet.", "id": 798}, {"review": "For not a whole lot of money it does what more expensive EQ pedals do. Its well made and sturdy with a metal body.", "id": 835}]
