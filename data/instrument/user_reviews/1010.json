I remember these from 35 years ago in high school band.  They haven't changed much, don't fix it if it's not broken.", "id": 158}, {"review": "Replacing your pickguard?  Lost a screw?

Tried all the off brands but came back to Fender picks in the end.", "id": 332}, {"review": "Not really bright enough. Both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same.
