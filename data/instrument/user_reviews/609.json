[{"review": "One Spots come with an 8-pedal multi plug. If you only have 4 pedals, or lets say you have 12, powering them with an 8 plug makes it difficult to isolate power and noise levels properly. The left over connectors can cause ground issues if they touch things when they aren't plugged into pedals. Using this smaller multi plug will leave less open spaces, alternatively it can be attached to any link in another multiplug to add more plugs. Very nice quality, just as with all one spot stuff. Great price, great purchase.", "id": 192}, {"review": "Simple. Solid. Compact. Convenient. Audio quality is unchanged from my no name metal patch cables. For the money, you can't beat a six pack of these to open up some extra space on your board and clean it up a bit.", "id": 207}, {"review": "The velcro itself is insanely amazing. Its so amazing that its stronger than the adhesive backing. If you have an alternative means to adhere this velcro to its surface with a strength stronger than 10 men, then by all means, use this stuff. In the end, you just can't make velcro this strong for use with a pedal board. Once together, it raises the height of the pedal very uncomfortably. I cannot think of a practical application for this velcro.", "id": 765}, {"review": "I have owned almost every octave/harmonizer/pitch shifter on the market. For what this tiny 80 dollar box is capable of, you cant beat it. First off, Its polyphonic. You wont find that in anything else under $300. Instant tracking, wide range of versatility, perfect volume balancing and very solid design. Only two flaws: a very slight hum when compared to buffered bypass pedals, still doesnt hum as bad as my POG did. The only flaw that irks me is that the affected note comes slightly flat when using just the pitch shift mode. Its very minute but a well trained ear in a solo session will hear it plain as day. Otherwise this inexpensive powerhouse is a grand slam. Great job Mooer, i cant wait to try more of your stuff.", "id": 850}, {"review": "I've owned Loop Stations, DM-4s, Jam Mans, Samplers and all that jazz. They're all full of crap you dont need. This pedal has flawless, colorless sound quality. It records what you sound like. You click it on, record your riff, click it and listen to it loop. Tap twice to stop or tap twice and hold to start over. You can record up to five minutes with unlimited layers. Smallest, Cheapest, easiest to use and most straight forward loop pedal you will find. If you need all the drum loops and the ability to save loops for later use, then dont get this one, but if you just want a good way to jam with yourself or a live loop similar to the DM-4 but with more time on the loop then yes get this.", "id": 869}]
