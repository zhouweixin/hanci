[{"review": "I have now purchased 3 of these guitar straps for my main guitars. I absolutely love them! Great quality, very strong, and great variation of length on them. They are also very wide which is very nice on the shoulders. I highly recommend this strap!", "id": 188}, {"review": "For the money, you cannot beat these strings. I change strings every other time I play a show (about once a month) and these always last, and sound good. Perfect for Ibanez guitars with special tuning.", "id": 227}, {"review": "I have always loved Hercules products. Their mic stands and guitar stands. They are great quality and very handy, especially this one, for performances where 3 guitars are used.", "id": 301}, {"review": "These cables are very good quality. I like the different colors for organizational purposes on stage. They are good quality, and very durable.", "id": 424}, {"review": "Seem to work well. Keep the ground switch selected, and it will do just fine. I have used different direct boxes and I recommend this one.", "id": 606}, {"review": "I bought this in order to have one in my 12 string guitar case. I like to keep a capo in each of my guitar cases. It works okay for 6 string guitars, but not even okay for 12 string guitars, plus the spring, became loose. You get what you pay for in this case.", "id": 837}, {"review": "good product  great price  works well so far  bought 2 for the price of one of the others  free ship  one for the road  one for pratice", "id": 150}, {"review": "I bought two of these for my band, and they are fantastic. Granted they are not the Hercules stands that I use, but they work for my two other singers. Great quality, and I would definitely buy them again.", "id": 279}, {"review": "The absolute best guitar stand made. Strong, and durable. I bought one about 4 months ago, and just ordered a second. Hercules is by far the best quality for musical instrument stands.", "id": 337}]
