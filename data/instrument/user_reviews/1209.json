[{"review": "I started doing a lot of fingerstyle guitar playing, and it seems to have made my fingertips slick.  So I have a hard time holding on to picks (when I use them) on upstrokes.  I'm sure I could improve my technique and fix the problem, but it's more fun to blame the pick!  These picks were no different from picks without the &#34;gator grip&#34; IMHO.  But Gorilla Snot worked beautifully.", "id": 65}, {"review": "They are cheap and look good.  They also have a nice full sound and are holding up well.  Highly recommended.", "id": 201}, {"review": "I am a converted guitar player and I like playing with a pick.  I like that sharp thwack sound.  But the tone can be a little harsh, so I got these.  They are much quieter than a hard pick but the tone is not the same as bare fingers.  For me, they were a waste of money.", "id": 243}, {"review": "I used to use the Martin tube thing that you stick between the strings.  But it was a bit of a pain.  You had to soak it, then drain it, then wipe it.  Even then, I worried about it dripping on the inside of the guitar.  This is much easier and the guitar sounds great.  Highly recommended.", "id": 314}, {"review": "The capo looks nice and works without any problem.  You can tell it is a cheaper model because the action is stiff.  But the build is solid, and it looks like it will last for a long time.", "id": 807}]
