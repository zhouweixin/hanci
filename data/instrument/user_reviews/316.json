[{"review": "This is a great music stand.  Very solid  feel.  No need to over tighten the adjusters.  It holds my heaviest books without tipping over.", "id": 155}, {"review": "I lose picks so easily I needed a pick hold.  This one sticks well to the guitar.  Locating a spot for it depends on you and your guitar.  Unless you keep it full of picks it will rattle. So I push one or two extra picks partly in the holder to stop it.  I might try it somewhere on the strap.", "id": 233}, {"review": "I was surprised at the sound that this amp produces.  The build quality is top notch.  Tuner is right on, overdrive seems fine.  I'm not an overdrive player.Cons: so far none and I don't expect any.", "id": 528}, {"review": "It fits well on my Les Paul and Strat.  Does Not fly off the head when playing.  It's very easy to read with or without the back light being on depending on room ambient lighting.  The light works really well and that was what I was looking for.  As far as accuracy it's right on in either setting.", "id": 595}, {"review": "I started using these a few years ago.  Picks always slip out of my fingers and this rougher surface really helps.", "id": 680}]
