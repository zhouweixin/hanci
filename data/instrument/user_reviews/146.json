[{"review": "It is so small and cute and totally fits my guitar with and without the bag. So if it is outside the bag of course I can showcase my guitar. The guitar inside the bag fits perfectly too. It stands as it should and it was a snap (literally) to set up it was like three steps or something. Wow. I am very impressed considering the price!!!!", "id": 92}, {"review": "I seriously do is so small and cute and it goes on the back of my guitar and I have great access to it. Fantastic.", "id": 167}, {"review": "It is really helpful to a person like me that knows jack squat about music. I really do recommend it is tiny so it is not all big and in your face and you can easily take it off if it does bother you.", "id": 762}, {"review": "They are picks for guitars and they work. They also have pretty colors. Right now I am just writing to get the required words out. If you dont want anything heavy this is good for you.", "id": 773}, {"review": "Well I guess it works? I don't know what I was expecting. I was hoping to get something cheap but that works for my classic guitar. I had to tie the other end around the guitar area but I don't know I guess it is okay it doesn't really bother me it is just that I wasnt expecting it. Also the actual band where I can put around my body is not THAT comfortable but it is okay and I can move around in it and secure it to my body.", "id": 776}]
