[{"review": "Durable, yet lightweight and sturdy. And, the price is right. Pacific hardware is excellent, right up there with Tama. I would buy this again.", "id": 138}, {"review": "Any size Wuhan china sounds great. This little 12-inch model is high-pitched, but has that trashy Wuhan sound. I prefer Wuhan to any Zildjian, Paiste, or Sabian china.", "id": 144}, {"review": "Very comfortable bench. It's wider than most, which makes is more comfortable to use. It feels heavy duty, and stays still during use.", "id": 362}, {"review": "Mid-level quality. The shoulder strap tends to move while you play. Gets the job done, but not for the serious guitarist.", "id": 470}, {"review": "This little unit is packed with great effects. For $50, I'm very impressed. Has just about everything you need in a entry-level pedal, except for a pedal control!!", "id": 600}, {"review": "Very close to the sound of an SM-58. Not quite as &#34;warm&#34; as the Shure, but this mic has the best sound for the price. I'm very impressed.", "id": 690}]
