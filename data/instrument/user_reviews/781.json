[{"review": "i've been using these tortex picks for a few years now and won't buy any others.  they feel great, don't fall out of my hands, and have a decent life span (plus the turtle logo is sweet)", "id": 61}, {"review": "this thing is sturdy, inexpensive, and does it's job.  no scratches or anything on my taylor.  it falls over now and then but only when i run into it", "id": 92}, {"review": "i bought one, then i bought two more, then i bought two more.these things are well made (in the good ol' US of A), look good, and are a deal.  none of my guitars have fallen off of the wall, which is good, right?", "id": 166}, {"review": "Personally, I love the nanoweb strings.  I have 4 guitars, and they each get played once every couple weeks.  As I'm no pro, I don't want to put strings on them that I'm going to have to change every time, just to mess around at my apt.I don't mind that they are extra slippery, or that they sound a tad bit \"different\" than other strings.  They're exactly what I want - A string that makes my guitar sound good for 4 months without changing strings.", "id": 295}, {"review": "i feel strange giving this classic only 3 stars.  but it's just not for me.  it's large and takes up space on my pedal board.  i prefer the little big muff", "id": 308}, {"review": "I've used these on the reg for a year.  Obviously there are better sounding monitors out there, but these are really great for what you pay for IMO.I'd recommend these to someone trying to save some money.UPDATEtwo years in with continued regular use.  they sound just as good as they did a year ago.", "id": 502}]
