[{"review": "This was exactly what I was after. I have a voice touch and needed a small cord to connect the mic to the voice touch and this was perfect. Before I used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches. I highly recommend this for those who keep the mic on a stand and have a voice touch or other stand connected device for vocals.", "id": 5}, {"review": "Liked this capo it worked fine. You can double this as a hand exercise device since it has a great amount of tension.", "id": 116}, {"review": "I have a Taylor 710ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar. Rather than ruin the finish of the guitar I just got a different strap. Plus the nylon slips very easy which is not a plus for me since I had to keep correcting the position of the guitar to where I liked it to play. If the nylon is not a problem for you and the ends fit over your guitar this strap is very well made.", "id": 208}, {"review": "Great foot switch that is easy to use. I figured out that the whole body lifts up to expose the battery compartment. Wish they had put that in some instructions. If it's there I missed it.", "id": 212}, {"review": "A friend made a comment that the cord looked like an old iron electric cord. LOL The cord delivers good sound quality. The only problem I have with it is that it gets tangled up rather easy.", "id": 876}]
