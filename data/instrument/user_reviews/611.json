[{"review": "These DAddario EXL110 strings are light, responsive and make my Gibson guitar sound great.  They work great. Why use anything else?", "id": 156}, {"review": "This low cost, compact microphone and stand is perfect for my local speaking engagements.  I connect it to my portable 20 watt amp and provides the sound I need in intimate settings.  The stand is surprisingly stable and good quality.", "id": 422}, {"review": "This is a great padded case that fits my soprano uke just right.  I like to ride my bike and take my uke along. The small size means it fits my panniers just fine.  The thick padding protects the uke from bumps and scrapes.  The larger foam/nylon cases are nice and offer more robust protection but they don't fit into a shopping bag or backpack nearly as well.  Highly recommended for the adventurous uke player.", "id": 593}, {"review": "Cool little digital tuner  that works great on my ukulele. Small and unobtrusive, unlike my other digital tuners.  I like the backlit display with simple markings that make easy to tell if you are in tune with a quick glance.  Highly recommended.", "id": 785}, {"review": "I don't often capo my guitar.  When I do,  I need something that goes on quickly and is firm on the neck.  You can't get better than this.", "id": 843}, {"review": "Awesome audio interface.  Perfect for my beginner studio setup. All set to trade my tracks with fellow musicians around the globe. Easy set up", "id": 874}, {"review": "These strings sound great. I Love the sustained bright tone. They work well with my cedar top guitar.  Easy on the fingers too.", "id": 130}]
