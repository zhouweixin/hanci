[{"review": "I love these little guitar stands. They are small enough to go anywhere with you, and they are cheap enough that you can keep a couple of them around. Which is good if you are as clumsy as I am.The last two of these that I have owned met untimely deaths. The first was on stage and since it is so small I tripped over it on the back of the stage. The second one I tripped over and ended up falling off of the stage. I know, I know... but they really are cool little stands, and I just bought another one lol. I am a glutton for punishment!", "id": 91}, {"review": "I used to play with celluloid picks back in the 70's before they came out with Delrin. I like the sound and feel of these picks. They add a nice round sound that works well with jazz, and funk. They are a little expensive, but I think they are worth it if you need the sound and feel of the real thing.I bought the abalone ones because they look cool...***UPDATE***I am still using these picks but they tend to break along the colored lines, and usually during a performance. I have since gone back to Delrin and Nylon.", "id": 120}, {"review": "Other reviewers have mentioned that the slot that goes over the strap peg is tight. They are correct, but it stays on like a monkey riding a motorcycle. For the bread this is a great strap. Buy one and see what I mean. My uncle played with a couple of old boot laces for a strap back in the day. Treat yourself and leave your laces in your boot...", "id": 190}, {"review": "I have several other amps ranging from half stacks to twins and this little guy fills a definite hole. I mainly play an American Standard Tele and the 25R fits her like a glove. I love the tone and the reverb for $100 is amazing! The dirty channe is what it is, but the clean channel is worth the price of admission.I can imagine using this guy for a small gig, but I mainly use it for practice and jamming over night while everyone else is sleeping. If you are in the market for a sweet little amp with a very rich clean channel and classic spring reverb you should look no further, this really is a great little amp!**Update**If you are interested in a DIY amp stand that will enhance the sound of the amp, check out my review and amp stand plans for the 25R on my website![...]", "id": 223}, {"review": "I play bass in a lot of different environments, and I never know what to expect before I show up. If I am playing a venue where I can use my head and 4x12 combo I know I'll have great tone. If I am going direct into the board I am at the mercy of the house equipment and engineer. This unit gives me ;the ability to still go direct, but allows me to tweak the signal for maximum warmth. I suppose you could look at this like an effects stomp box but it is really so much more. if you play at church and are tired of hearing the life sucked out of your bass you should give this a try. I love it.", "id": 236}, {"review": "I bought one of Snark's \"Super Tight\" tuners and found it to be less then advertised. It will get you in tune, but this tuner does so much better of a job for a lot less. I am going to buy another so I have one in the studio, and one on my stage rig. Buy it. It's a great little tuner!", "id": 706}, {"review": "No, this tuner is NOT super tight. It's ok, but not super tight. I bought this because the tuner in the RP1000 is pretty sloppy. Based on owning this for a couple of weeks, I would say that it is just about as sloppy as the RP1000. I will use it on stage, but for recording I will stick to the app on my phone. Oh yeah, I almost forgot -- when you register the tuner you get a PDF download of \"Secret Chords The Pro's Don't Know\". It's good for a laugh.Pros: Bright easy to read display, fast response timeCons: Nowhere near what I would call super tight.Bottom line: Save your bread and get something else if you need a tight tuning. I would suggest the Snark SN-1. It's cheaper and works very well!", "id": 811}, {"review": "This is my favorite acoustic guitar stand. It's easy to use on stage, it can be used with only one hand, and it has a low profile that doesn't take up a lot of space when folded, and it doesn't stick out as an eyesore on stage. I use this thing constantly, and can wholeheartedly recommend it.", "id": 601}, {"review": "I bought this for my son so he could record with it. He does stuff on the internet with other people musically and says it works good for him.", "id": 782}]
