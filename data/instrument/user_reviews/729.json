[{"review": "OK - I like this one a lot.  It stays on the instrument and allows for a quick tune up at anytime.  It is accurate, easy to see and use and does not get in the way while playing.  It sure beats the other units I have used where you clamp on some weird thing, tune up and then stash back in your gig bag.This one is... bing! - on, tune and back to playing.  It weighs next to nothing so you do not even notice it unless you are tuning up.", "id": 785}, {"review": "I love this thing.  It quickly and accurately allows for tuning on any instrument I own (electric & acoustic guitars, electric & acoustic bass guitars).  It clips on securely, is easy to see, stays out of the way from my playing hands and is a breeze to turn on & off.  From the front, you can barely notice it at all.  I just leave it on my instrument all the time and use it as needed.  When I switch to another instrument I un-clip it and take it with me to what ever I want to play next.I love this thing.  Love it, love it love it!", "id": 811}, {"review": "I like this capo because it goes on quickly and there is no pulling the strings out of tune.  A bit large for one of my cases, but it still makes it in there ok.  Seems well made so I am not worried that it will break or need replacing for a long time.", "id": 843}, {"review": "This is one of the nicer capo's Ive used.  Certainly superior to the old school band-based jobs from yesteryear.  One of the nicest features is it can be clipped on the head while not in use and then you can quickly grab, position, release and go.  Heck, you could probably place it mid-song if you were so inclined to do so.Also it clamps without bending the strings.I've used it on my Start, Les Paul and Martin all with no complaints. I hardly ever use a capo, but if I need one, I am glad to have this one.", "id": 894}, {"review": "I really like these strings.  While they are not quite as bright sounding as uncoated strings, they still sound better than many other strings, AND they last so much longer.  They will easily out last a set of uncoated strings by at least 2x... probably closer to 3x.  Nice tactile feel on the right hand with reduced squeak as you move up & down the neck.Bottom line is Elixir's sound great, play well and least a really long time.", "id": 899}, {"review": "These bright sounding strings are easy to play, hold up well and rarely break.  One of my favorite strings for my Les Paul.  I tend to go with Ernie Ball Super Slinky's on my Strat, but these would probably sound nice on a Strat as well.", "id": 156}]
