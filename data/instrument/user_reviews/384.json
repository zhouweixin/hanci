[{"review": "I use this for recording guitars as well as live vocals.  I've knocked this microphone around a decent amount, and it is plenty rugged.  I couldn't be happier with it.", "id": 19}, {"review": "I put a pair of these on every guitar that I own.  I have a lot of extra strap clips around since I have many more guitars than straps, but these are great; they are all plenty tough, and if I find myself with my Straplok'd strap, it's nice that these work fine with a normal strap in a pinch.", "id": 44}, {"review": "I've been hooked on D'Addarios for quite a while.  The per-unit price on these is great, and I never worry about breaking one of these.", "id": 156}, {"review": "These work just fine as replacement mounting screws for  single-coil pickups mounted to a pickguard, though they seem to be too thick to fit through the standard holes in a humbucker (nothing that a little drilling out couldn't fix, if you're so inclined).", "id": 599}, {"review": "These come with two Velcro straps to hold the cable in a bundle, which is convenient.  I use this for a microphone, and it seems to be solidly-built.  If I need more, I'll probably buy this again.", "id": 692}, {"review": "This tuner does a great job tracking notes rather quickly, and I've enjoyed using it.  It does its job, and it's well worth the money.", "id": 811}]
