[{"review": "These came on my American Tele in 2004, and I've been buying them ever since.  Sweet action, durable, and very affordable.", "id": 89}, {"review": "An opinion on guitar strings is fairly subjective.  With that said, I've been stringing my jackson soloist w/ floyd rose with these strings for years.  I've never had a problem, and I wouldn't buy anything else.", "id": 156}, {"review": "Genuine fender pick guard.  It's pre-shielded.  Perfect for your next build, or for replacing your standard white guard to set you apart.", "id": 217}, {"review": "I picked up another one of these for a new guitar and I'm very impressed.  They've upgraded the design to be a bit better than the one I purchased a few years ago.  Excellent stand!", "id": 258}, {"review": "I live in Arizona and I keep my acoustic in the case with this dampit unless I'm playing it.  It seems to do a good job, although I would recommend purchasing a better meter.  The one it comes with is a simple paper design that gives you a decent estimate.", "id": 299}, {"review": "These are great tuners, and they look great.  I've never had a lot of interest in locking tuners, except on my floyd rose guitars.", "id": 560}, {"review": "Not much to say about this one.  It's a genuine fender trem cover, and it will do its job well.", "id": 562}]
