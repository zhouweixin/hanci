[{"review": "I've been using the D'Addario strings for about 10 years now... US steel, US made and private labels provider for many other brands of strings.  (in other words many other flashy string package companies are just the middleman between you and the best strings... little known fact in the industry)  Their tone and longevityrivals any other string in the industry.

Even the crunch button is just a louder sound?  Not a very good value unless you try it out first and this is exactly the sound you're looking for.  Guess that's why it's so cheap.", "id": 757}]
