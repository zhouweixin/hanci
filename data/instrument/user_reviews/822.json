Now with this stand it sits front and center next to my computer. It really makes the guitar stand out. It was relatively easy to assemble with just one person doing it. I recommend this product. Works as advertised and looks sturdy like it will last a long time.", "id": 519}, {"review": "I was given free picks when I bought my guitar from a local guitar shop in town. The Retailer gave me some mediums. I find I do better with heavy thickness. I have a heavy touch when I play the guitar. With the different thicknesses I can choose which works best for me. From experience it never hurts to have extra picks around. Since I bought these I have been using the Heavy thickness ones. They really bring out the extra sound in the strings on the guitar.", "id": 878}]
