[{"review": "If you'd ever been setting up on stage and discover hum or hiss this box is for you. It will find a bad or intermittent calbe in a heart beat. It will locate a shorted XLR or an open ground fast. Don't go onto the stage without one on these boxes.", "id": 318}, {"review": "What can you say about a simple device that does exactly what it supposed to do. I used to put my water on the stage an 1/2 the time kick it over. Now it's right where I can find it everytime.", "id": 530}, {"review": "I always put my recorder on the stage on a mini tripod that would get kicked over by band members. Now I put my recorder on my monitor mike stand and don't worry about it anymore. Simplicity at its best.", "id": 548}, {"review": "Love this thing. It sounds awesome and is built like a tank. It sound as good as $300 to $400 monitors and the music stand mounting is clever. Does everything I want in a personal stage monitor.", "id": 654}, {"review": "Works great, sounds great, it's a bit on the large side but is solidly built and simple to operate. Tascam rocks.", "id": 750}, {"review": "If your a musician (or want to be?) recording you practices and rehearsals are an important part of your ability to learn to play well. I have found recording to be extremely important to my ability to learn new songs and that having been said, you cannot beat a Tascam recorder for ease of operation, features and sound quality. Enough said, buy a Tascam if you serious about your music.", "id": 755}]
