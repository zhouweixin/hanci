I haven't had any Problems with them, They installed just Fine. I did have to put a Tooth pick in one of the Screw holes to tighten it up.", "id": 682}, {"review": "This is a Very nice cable, I like this one better than all the other ones that I Own, Its thick and the sound is great. Then one day an Amp was bumped over in such a way that the cable end was broken or sheared off, That stunk", "id": 803}]
