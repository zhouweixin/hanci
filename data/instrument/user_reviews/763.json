[{"review": "I'll try to review the strings and not the instrument but that's kinda hard for me to do. I've been playing guitar since my Dad bought me a $7.00, unknown acoustic 46 years ago. That should make me about 58. He put some brand new humpty duty Black Diamond strings on it which pulled the neck up to where the strings sat around 6\" off the fretboard. Well, they weren't very close anyway. The neck had no way to adjust it so imagine learning to play using heavy gauge Black Diamond strings a ways from the fretboard. I didn't know any better so I thought it was normal for the blood dripping off my bent crooked fingertips.Since then I've been through a multitude of guitars and strings. I always wanted a Les Paul but my playing never improved enough to justify $2000.00 - $4000.00. I started reading reviews on the Epiphone Les Paul 100 for $249.00 and they were running from 4.5 - 5 stars. I finally, after much self convincing, bought the ebony through Amazon. I've owned Strats, Telecasters, cheapies, an Alvarez I think. I unpacked it out of the box, did a little tuning and this is absolutely, the most beautiful, sweetest thing I've ever held in my life, (except for the little lady of course). No kidding, I recommend this guitar to anyone even if it cost a couple of grand.Strings: The ones that came on there sounded great. I didn't put it down for a couple of weeks. Sounds great in the bathroom, good acoustics. I finally got the best out of that set of strings. I always use Ernie Ball on everything. They've got a wrench to fit every nut in the house. I saw some Hybrids on Amazon and had never heard of them. I bought a pack of them along with some Super Slinkys, Regular Slinkys, Earthwood Silk & Steels. I put the Hybrids on the new Les Paul. They made it sound even better than it was. Chuck Barry, The Ventures, Clapton, set the LP and Fender amp right and the sound is just as good. The lower strings have a wonderful rich tone, they're fairly heavy but easy on the fingers. The high strings will talk to you. I can bend the g-string easier than a Super Slinky. This is the only guitar I've used them on but they sound great. I imagine I'll stick with them for this machine from now on. Of course Amazon is always 5 stars in my book.", "id": 240}, {"review": "I needed a single button switch for my little Mustang I that I practice on. I've never owned the Fender model switch but I know what it is. It will do the job but it's lightweight and won't sit flat on the floor if the cord isn't laying exactly right. I searched a little further and ran across this switch on Amazon by scrolling down a bit. \"Marshall Footswitch, One Button With LED by AmplifiedParts.\" Folks, this thing is built like a tank. The casing is made of heavy duty (I don't know what gauge) solid steel. There's nothing rinky dink about it. I plugged it in to the FTSW jack, clicked the button, the LED lit up and the amp switched to the other tagged preset. Again, light went out and back to the original. It felt solid under my foot and I don't think one can tear the casing up unless they have a 3 or 4 lb. sledge hammer. I don't know how well the electronics will hold up (I just got it today) but the switch, again, feels solid like it's supposed to. It cost me $20.90 with shipping. It takes a couple of days longer to arrive than what we're use to with Amazon but it ships directly from AmplifiedParts, I believe. I'm a Fender fan but this beats their single switch. Thanks for reading guys. Lane H.", "id": 563}, {"review": "This little fellow is great. The proper connection from the Focusrite comes with the box. Hooks to the USB port on my MacBook Pro. Everything else plugs right in. No hassle with the right jacks and stuff. My headphone jack was a different size but I went from 1/8 to 1/4&#34; with a reducer I had on hand. I can turn the computer on and play my guitars without opening a program. I've been recording using Garage Band. Works great. Anytime I can get a product that works as it's suppose to without a lot of hassle hooking up cables or other stuff, it's a 5 Star in my book. Oh. There are two ports for speakers on the back side I haven't used yet. Just trying to decide what speakers to purchase.", "id": 801}, {"review": "I wanted a pickup for my relatively inexpensive violin. It sounds pretty good for the price I paid for it. I was actually in the market for an electric violin and while shopping Amazon ran across this inexpensive pickup for an acoustic. I purchased it at the same time I bought the electric violin. Naturally when the electric arrived, I laid the acoustic pick up off to the side and went to work on the electric. A few days later I thought I would give the pickup a try. It slides right in and out of an F hole with no problem. I plugged it into my Fender amp with a little reverb and WOW is how I can describe what came out. It sounded like I was in a Great Concert Hall. Of course there is no adjustments on the pickup so everything is done with the settings on the amp. Whatever your amp is capable of, your violin can do it. Now I haven't tried to blow it up or anything but the sound is tremendous. Cant say enough except the price was so low I couldn't have gone wrong too bad.", "id": 848}, {"review": "This little fellow is well built out of mostly steel and is heavy for its size. The locking knobs do their job without fail and I don't have to over crank them to get them to hold. I use it sitting on top of my table which holds my computer, recording interface and all the other stuff I use for recording. It adjust perfect for vocals and I drop it down if I want to use it for recording my acoustic guitars without using a pickup. Same with my violins. I get a different sound recording through a mic than I do a pickup.The base is heavy and will hold a mic with the boom extended all the way. You must turn one foot in the direction of use to get a full extension but with a minute retraction, it will stand securely in any direction. I set it where I want it then just swing it out of the way till I need it. I have used it sitting on the floor by my chair and reaches fine for vocals or acoustics. It's just more accessible on the desk. This would work fine for drummers.I would recommend this to any of my critical buddies. Thanks", "id": 77}]
