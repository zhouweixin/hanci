[{"review": "its working great, but it does not work in stereo. It is a mono adapter, the stereo adapters are a little more expensive.", "id": 569}, {"review": "The tuning is accurate, the LCD screen is clearly visible, it works great!! I'm not sure about battery life, I haven't gotten there yet.", "id": 627}, {"review": "It tunes without any problems... and I love using the word \"SNARK\"!! I thought the creaters could have implemented the \"clip\" feature I have seen on other tuners, which tunes through vibrations, but it still works great!!!!", "id": 724}, {"review": "I drop my pics on purpose now just so I can use it more often! It does what it's supposed to do, what else can I say.", "id": 70}, {"review": "I could not be happier. Once in a while it will catch ambient sounds, but I love this tuner. It does not eat up battery power, and keeps me tuned right on!!! A bit better than Snark, but if you love saying SNARK. Just get snark!!!!", "id": 595}]
