[{"review": "It works as advertised.  Replaced missing tremolo bar.  I don't normally use one, but if I ever wanted to sell the Strat I would want to sell it complete.", "id": 558}, {"review": "Long wait for overpriced item.  Arrived on time but there was a 3 week wait. Overpriced but was expected as Fender name on product..", "id": 571}, {"review": "I buy and sell electric guitars and often I meet with someone at a half-way point where access to electricity is unavailable. I was surprised at the volume and tone that came out of a unit so small.  There is even and overdrive which makes this totally cool as some of my customers want to schredd a little.  This is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter.  I bought a Planet Waves 9V Power adapter to go with the Honey Tone.  It might work in a Busker situation.", "id": 303}, {"review": "Bought these as normal finger picks were not working for me.  I grew up playing without picks when playing finger-style and the transition to wearing picks was not going well. I can wear these either on the outside or inside of the nail. These are working a lot better for me.", "id": 404}, {"review": "I needed a 9-volt adapter to use with an Danelectro N10B Honey Tone Mini Amp.  This was recommended and I am happy with the product.", "id": 521}, {"review": "Exactly what I needed for testing guitars and playing at home.  Same as what comes with epiphone bundles but with fender on it", "id": 564}]
