[{"review": "I have two sets of these for my straps.  The push button action is most convenient vs. fighting stubborn leather openings, especially if new.  The gold finish matches my instrument's hardware and they are sturdy and durable.  Works for me!", "id": 44}, {"review": "Surprisingly this cloth is both soft and durable.  Works well with polish on natural wood instruments.  I plan to get another one for my laptop computer because of it's cling quality to dust.", "id": 437}, {"review": "I have both this tuner and a Snark for each of my instruments.  Though I am not a professional musician, I find each them to be of equal accuracy.  In fact, the D'Addario's compact size and fit is totally un-noticeable and though its screen is micro in size, it is very clear and viewable denoting flat/sharp notation.  A great choice for the price.", "id": 785}, {"review": "This thing is dead on the money when it comes to tuning.  It has many features I have yet to utilize, but good to know they are there if needed.", "id": 811}, {"review": "Compared to Ernie Ball's cloth, it's good enough for wiping down things.  It is soft and non abrasive; EB's cloth has that and also has a clinging element which seemingly cleans and absorbs. Overall good cloth for general use.", "id": 184}, {"review": "Study strap. Great feel, leather matches my instrument well. 2-1/2&#34; width worked well for me compared to the 4&#34; version.", "id": 484}]
