[{"review": "the best idea anyone who strings a bass can decide on. I am a fan of the Slinky guitar strings so I got these for my freetless Schecter 4 string bass. Like they were made for it.", "id": 93}, {"review": "this is not the greatest product they make - but it works quickly and makes the 12 string spread when needed to do so more easily than most.", "id": 116}, {"review": "many similar products for much more money do not do as well as these simply designed easy to use & install hangars. They are reliable (so far), they do not hurt anything on your instrument, & I am using one for my heavy fretless bass as well as my guitars & violin! How self adjusting can they be!? apparntly - quite!", "id": 779}, {"review": "I always LOVE THESE!Moreso because I am not getting ripped off by a Brick & Mortar shoppe for a tool of the trade.", "id": 90}, {"review": "quiet, almost hum free - clear respose - no volume control doesn't befront me because i use it to record & to play thru a PA where either I or someone else keeps the volume under control. It tends to be bass heavy, but a slight eq revisit more than compensates for that. I had used one in the past, this is a more solid unit & fits movement free in the soundhole of my guitar & also in two others i use here and there. great job. great value. got herre quick in a nice little carry bag & I will update if problems come later - don't see why or how tho", "id": 129}]
