[{"review": "I returned this because I wanted the script version instead. Very different sound. Watch YouTube to compare models. This pedal seems older as well.", "id": 177}, {"review": "I own all 3 versions of this pedal and cherish each one of them. This one is my favorite, turn on and go. I think it's better than the Sovereign.", "id": 397}, {"review": "I own all 3 versions of this pedal and cherish them. If you need more control with EQ, This pedal with switchable top boost is the ticket. More versatile than the Sovereign.", "id": 399}, {"review": "awesome cord hope they make more and the world will be a better place, peace and love to you all !!!!!!!", "id": 554}, {"review": "Very nice tone and effect for a one knob pedal. If all you need is a simple chorus effect this will satisfy.", "id": 672}, {"review": "Great overdrive/distortion for classic rock music.  Good volume roll off tones , at full bore it sounds like VH, and some other 80s rock dudes. It's quiet and has a very active tone control. The crunch switch adds a touch of high end harmonic , not too much but just enough. MXR has come around to making pedals that do what they say they will do. I now own  a Script Phase 90, and a Micro Chorus as well and plan on getting others. I'm a classic rock player these pedals have a classic 60s + vibe.", "id": 757}]
