Wish that it had a on/off switch but you can get around that.  Great for instruments and vocals as well.  Was delivered on time as well, amazon is the best and have the best vendor.", "id": 594}, {"review": "I look at many stands before I brought this one, the rating were great and I'm very pleased with the purchase.  If I need another stand I will buy this one again with no hesitation.", "id": 77}]
