[{"review": "I normally use nylon picks but do some songs with flatpicking intros and the nylons were to flappy. These picks keep a nice bright tone, very little friction on the strings - so low string noise. Enough grip to stay put in hands well too.", "id": 54}, {"review": "I have been using Dunlop picks for a long time. Good feel, grip and not too heavy or thick. Good deal.", "id": 62}, {"review": "I haven't used this yet, but it seems solid and idiot proof - just like I need. Play coffee shops and will help if I drop my pick. Very good price.", "id": 210}, {"review": "Very happy with these cables. Just finished cutting my first home multi track recording and they did the job. Well made and look and feel sturdy.", "id": 439}, {"review": "My friend has commented on its bright color - \"you'll never lose that thing!\" I hope he's right cause I love this little tuner. Works well and easier to read than many of its competitors.", "id": 706}, {"review": "I have been playing and singing off and on for close to 20 years and currently host an open mic at a local coffee shop. I have used lots of great equipment and mics including the oft mentioned sm57 and sm58. While I did not have either one of those to do an a/b comparison - I DID have 2 high-end (over $100 mics) to compare these too. One was an EV and the other a rather costly older Peavey. These mics compared favorably to both with a slighter flatter frequency response. The signal was not quite as hot as the EV and Peavey, but far more resistant to feedback - even when turned up to match the hotter volumes of the other 2. Can't speak to their longevity or reliability yet, but seems sturdy and a nice performing piece of musical equipment. I feel that these mics will compare favorably to anything under 150 bucks. Great value & highly recommended.", "id": 213}]
