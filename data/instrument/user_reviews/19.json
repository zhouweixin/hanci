[{"review": "Works well for a multi-tool.  personally you could get away with a little crank winder and a wire cutter, but this is nice to have in your bag just in case.  And for the price you really can't beat it.  3 tools in one handy spot.", "id": 94}, {"review": "Perfect for hanging displaying your guitars.  Very sturdy, they hold up well to both my Bass or guitar without moving or flexing (both are on the heavy end).  I own 3 now, and will definitely buy more if I expand my collection!", "id": 166}, {"review": "Great cloth for keeping those pesky fingerprints and other smudges off your valuable guitars.  Soft touch, easy care - can't beat it!", "id": 184}, {"review": "Friend of mine has been playing/cleaning/modifying guitars for some 30+ years and this is what he recommended I use on my guitar to clean it.  Who am I to argue with him, he's used them all and said this was the best.  Easy to use - a little goes a long way, works very well and shines up nice.  He was right - great product!", "id": 351}, {"review": "Just an all around nice case, good construction, good zipper and padded enough without causing it to become hard to maneuver.  This isn't one of those semi walled cases, this is just a normal gig bag.  Works for me, in fact I bought another for my classical.", "id": 400}, {"review": "Wonderful tuner, I've used it for my acoustic and my bass and have had no problems at all.  Incredibly easy to use, super cheap and easy to just throw in your case and go.  Well worth the price!", "id": 820}, {"review": "Great product, I've use them before and have always thought they were top quality.  They aren't much larger than the originals that came with the guitar and that extra piece of mind is great!  Easy installation without any modification (at least on mine) and they connect/hold very solid.  Just make sure the buttons are all the way in or you could have mishap ;)", "id": 44}]
