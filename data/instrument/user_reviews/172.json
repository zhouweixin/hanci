[{"review": "Pretty sweet guitar for the price. Sounds like and plays like a Les Paul. I really like the vintage sunburst color (It's more orange than what the picture shows). The strings were setup on the nut close to the fret board the way I like it already when I got it. I just replaced the strings with heavier strings for personal preference. Overall, sounds and looks awesome! Would recommend it for anyone on a budget that wants the sound of a Les Paul.", "id": 31}, {"review": "Installed on two guitars and I love them! I can switch out many different guitar straps without worrying that they will fall off. Great product, would recommend to any guitar player!", "id": 44}, {"review": "Great build quality, works like it should. Feels comfortable to wear also. No complaints at all :) Great color also considering my guitar is a shade of green :D", "id": 74}, {"review": "This is a sweet guitar strap. I have a similar one but it has blue fire on it. These are very durable straps that won't fall off your guitar so you can play confidently. They are on the little bit of the stiff side where it can be kinda uncomfortable at times but it's expected since it's new. My blue fire strap from Dunlop is comfortable now since I've used it for awhile. So it's get better as you use it. Besides it being uncomfortable at first, it's an awesome strap and I would recommend it to anyone that has a guitar :)", "id": 172}, {"review": "This is an awesome amp. There are SO many settings on this amp you could spend hours with news sounds and effects, so sick! It's fun experimenting with different effects and mixing them to something new. Sometime I want to get the pedal for this amp to preset effects I like. Great amp if you're just looking for something to either mess around on or practice with. I play a lot of different songs on my electric guitars and this amp makes it really fun. I would recommend this to a beginner to an advanced player.", "id": 872}]
