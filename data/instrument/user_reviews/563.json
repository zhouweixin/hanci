[{"review": "just arrived in good shape. Polish w/ an expansive polishing cloth. Almost size of a dinner napkin which is nice as opposed to much smaller lens cleaning cloths.", "id": 194}, {"review": "I play metal so I need a strong pick (the Jazz III models) and this one also has a texture (Ultex) that makes it easier to hold onto/keep it in the right position. Second time I bought these.", "id": 413}, {"review": "exactly what I was looking for. A Jazz III- sized pick (smaller than a common-sized guitar pick) that works better for me because the grip nubs make it easier to keep it in the proper angle/position", "id": 686}, {"review": "item is really convienient. Small, unobtrusive size w/ good illumination for easy reading. I like the swivel design & swivel display that allow you to connect it to whatever side of the headstock you want. Price can't be beat either.", "id": 785}, {"review": "got this to treat my fretboard on my guitar. Nice airline-sized bottle w/ safety cap to prevent from unintentional opening. Replenished my dried out fretboard to like-new condition.", "id": 307}]
