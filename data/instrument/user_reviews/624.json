[{"review": "I read a review saying that there bridge was floating out & the strings were hard to tune aswell as their e string popping. I had the exact same experience but i bought two sets since i know uncoated strings dont last long. so i did get to play em but all my strings (except the A & E) popped on both sets within two weeks i knew it was due to my bridge being made to use a whammy bar (which it came with btw)& the tension it put on my tuning pegs what really got me upset about these strings was that they damaged my tuning pegs and now there harder to turn (have to use pliers sometimes) but the strings sound great & if i get a better guitar i might get these more often but for now im staying w/ medium gauge elixirs.", "id": 98}, {"review": "These are my favorite brand of strings.When i was a beginner a few years back these were the 1st strings i bought on my electric (since i used them on my acoustic) And i have to say, elixir is my favorite brand of strings. They last long, are easy to tune, & have a nice bright sound & if you take proper care of them (wipe them down when your done playing, keep the guitar in your gig bag when your not using it, ETC.) that bright sound can last about 6 MONTHS OR MORE!! i usually just buy about two sets a year & im a HEAVY player i play about 2-7 hours EVERYDAY. I love the coating aswell but the medium gauge & up usually don't have that other coating you can get on the light gauge strings, but overall these strings are awesome & are a must buy for every guitarist!", "id": 107}, {"review": "Elixir is my favorite brand of strings. I bought these seeking strings with longer life (after a bad experience w/  D'Addario strings only lasted a week or 2) and boy i'll tell you these babies LAST! i only change these strings twice a year & the coating makes it more comfortable & easier to slide on the strings. I love the bright sound you get and they are easy to tune & they also keep in tune good & overall these string are a must try for EVERY guitarist", "id": 109}, {"review": "I read the reviews for the bad shipping in the box & decided to take a risk since i really wanted to try fender picks & really wanted heavy picks & the shipping definitely improved it comes in a little plastic baggy & has the fender logo on it. but the picks takes a little getting used too there VERY slippery at 1st i thought it was just me but i lended a couple to a few friends and they had the same problem but overtime you develop a better grip on them and can alternate pick, sweep pick, tremelo pick, tap with the pick better. Also my pitch harmonics (better known as squealies) come out clearer to me. Overall the product is not an disappointment & im only using these pick (just in different colors) from now on ^.^", "id": 120}, {"review": "Its solid. Has great quality. & doesn't short out on you. I had it for a few months now & not a tear anywhere in site Planet Waves printed on the cord \"guaranteed for life\" i think they mean it XD", "id": 168}, {"review": "This amp is awesome! Its great JUST like it's advertised. I play more of the modern metal side but i managed to make quite a few sick distortions using the Fender Fuse software. Fender Fuse is very simple to use and once you get the hang of it you can get more detailed & advanced with your settings to get the tone you desire. The amp itself has 24 presets (as advertised) & are shown in 3 different colors (Red, Green, & Orange)  and you can totally customize the presets. So if you want 24 different distortions go for it! Another thing it comes with ableton live but its just a demo version of the program so u can look at the tutorials & learn how to use it & record some music but you can't save them (bummer i know) BUT! it gives you some kinda pass that allows you to save a few recordings. One last thing you can purchase a one button foot pedal (about $20)the Fender mustang 1&2 can only USE the 1 button foot pedal the foot pedals that uses 2 buttons or up can only be use by Fender Mustangs 3 & up REMEMBER THIS!", "id": 718}, {"review": "The fender 1 button footswitch is made specifically for the Fender Mustangs 1&2 It works exactly how i expected it to switches quickly and on point from effects though its only good for 2 effects (DUH!) the right angled plug is annoying after awhile because its RIGHT next too where you plug your guitar in and oftens get tangled with my guitar cord making it look messy. Other then that it gets the job done for when i practice & jam out with friends.", "id": 563}]
