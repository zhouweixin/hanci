Give a good phase sounds like Waylon would use.  Simple to use, one knob and it doesn't boost or reduce the signal", "id": 727}, {"review": "Got this tuner for my new bass.  clipped it onto the headstock, was able to tune without plugging it into the amp. clear bright display.  Might have to pickup a couple more of these for my other guitars", "id": 762}, {"review": "I've been very happy with all of my Joyo pedal's I've gotten, but I really love this one.
