[{"review": "It's noisy, but if you find out how to equalize the tone and volume, it works fine. I bought it cause Gilmour uses this effect but certainly the one he uses must be of a much more better quality product.", "id": 308}, {"review": "This product is great. You can have a lot of pedals including big ones and volume/wah pedals. Read the description so you can have a sense of size. Tue quality is very nice, solid and resistible. The soft case is very nice also.", "id": 544}, {"review": "This product is bad quality because the noise it makes. It increases the volume so much that it is better not to use it at all. I'm going to sell this product. I didn't like it.", "id": 758}, {"review": "It sounds good. Not as a professional tube driver, but quite well for the price. Perfect for begginners and intermediate players that can't afford something else that is a little bit more expensive.", "id": 472}, {"review": "This product is easy to use, without any noise at all. I truly recommend it as a tuner pedal. I'm happy with this product.", "id": 504}, {"review": "I was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived. Just to find out it WASN'T WORKING!!! it is defective, and because i brought it to Mexico, now i can't get a refund or a replacement.I will try to fix it through some local electrician or something. Very dissapointing!", "id": 672}]
