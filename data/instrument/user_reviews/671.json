[{"review": "This strap is not a bad one, but it just did not fit my guitar, so that is the only problem. I have a classical guitar and sadly, this strap does not fit it.", "id": 208}, {"review": "This stand is very nice, it is black and it does its job very well. It also has a strap on the top holder to secure the guitar when it is on the stand. It is like an added bonus.", "id": 310}, {"review": "These picks were a good deal. They are pretty cool looking and I will be able to use them for a long time. They are durable and they were a better deal than many other picks.", "id": 574}, {"review": "I chose this capo because I was just starting out and needed one for certain songs. This was a cheap capo, but it does its job well. I have no complaints about it at all.", "id": 603}, {"review": "This tuner gave me problems at first because I did not know how to use it. You have to attach it to the guitar in order for it to work, which is pretty cool. You don't have to hold it or put it on your leg. Also, this is very accurate and gives only a slight range to be in tune. It is a  great product.", "id": 706}]
