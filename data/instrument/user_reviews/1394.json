The sound that transfers through this cable is REMARKABLY IMPROVED over my old cable.  I urge you to purchase if you are looking...you won't be disappointed. BTW, I am a verified purchaser, just can't say enough good about this cable...I'm really impressed!", "id": 126}, {"review": "This stand is made of quality products.

Worth every penny.", "id": 519}, {"review": "This package of picks is of good colors and good weight.
