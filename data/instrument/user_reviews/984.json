[{"review": "I have owned other capos, but this one is simply the best. I doesn't take up a lot of room on the fret, yet the springs are strong and will hold properly for a long time.", "id": 116}, {"review": "This a very clever idea. It helps save floor space in your rooms, and it helps cover empty wall space. Very easy to take off/put on. High recommend this to any stringed-instrument players.", "id": 154}, {"review": "For the price of these strings, you can't go wrong. However, compared to Elixers, the sound just isn't as &#34;full.&#34;", "id": 225}, {"review": "I did my research on this buy. I looked at a lot of reviews, as well as youtube reviews comparing other headphones, and these seemed to be the clear favorites over other competitors such as Beats Pro (in which you're spending at least $100 of the total $200 on just the name alone, such a rip-off if you ask me). These are very clear and fine tuned. My only knock on these is that they could use a little more padding for the top of my head.", "id": 458}, {"review": "I always go with Elixirs. Great, long-lasting sound! I would recommend these to anyone, both experienced players and amateurs alike.", "id": 104}]
