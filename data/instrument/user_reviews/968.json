[{"review": "Good Quality, great price, easy to install, easy to lock and unlock, fast delivery. Better than going to the always overpriced Guitar Center.", "id": 44}, {"review": "Best guitar picks. Great shape, sturdy. No fancy expensive flashy grip features. Guitar pics as the God's of Rock intended.", "id": 117}, {"review": "Nice bright and full sound. Good life, they sound good for a couple of months. Inexpensive. Fast delivery. I am happy with this product.", "id": 333}, {"review": "Disapointed. The sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound. It sound muffled. I will have to replace it soon.", "id": 416}, {"review": "Unhappy with it, actually I already replaced them. The method of attachment is poorly designed, it doesn't matter how tight you screw the two sections of the lock with the catch balls, the thread slips and my guitar almost fell down to the ground in a couple of occasions. Expensive locks too.", "id": 513}, {"review": "Works great with my Fender Super Camp X2. Easy connection, easy activation of switches, immediate response. Small, light and compact. Great product.", "id": 535}, {"review": "One of the ball bearings designed to catch and lock the side mounted to the strap dislodged, and my very expensive Fender Custom Shop Telecaster fell flat on the ground.", "id": 682}, {"review": "Great product. Accurate, small, functional, inexpensive, better battery life to previous generations, very good quality, adapts easily to any type of guitar heads.", "id": 785}, {"review": "Amazon and TC Electronics will not tell you that you need a 9V Power Supply. I didn't see any warning or advise in the Point of Purchase, nor in the package. This is an unfair practice from Amazon and TC Electronics.", "id": 869}]
