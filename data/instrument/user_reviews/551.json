You can buy more expensive guitar strings, just not better guitar strings.

Clip it on and no matter how much noise is around you, it will still accurately tune the guitar. Very easy and simple to use.

I have it below 1 on the volume and it is still loud. The factory setup is great, but you can set it up anyway you want it.", "id": 872}, {"review": "I bought 3 of these and will by more for my guitar collection. Cheap but work.
