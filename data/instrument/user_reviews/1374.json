I use them on my portable desktop rack with my mobile DJ equipment and they have held strong.", "id": 22}, {"review": "I use this with my mobile DJ equipment and it is fantastic. Very sturdy and light enough to easily carry. Holes for screw mounts are perfectly placed and allow easy component installation. Plastic covers on the feet came off right away though, but not really a big deal to me.", "id": 322}, {"review": "I use this with my small mobile DJ setup mostly for microphone inputs when using my small mixer. Simple to use, works great, no hum or buzz at all.", "id": 374}, {"review": "Purchased two of these, one for on stage headphones and one to actually use as a junction box to send the sound elsewhere in the building to other amps/speakers.
