[{"review": "These are good strings, for a good price.  I have purchased these strings several times and they sound good and last a long time.", "id": 59}, {"review": "Exceeded my expectations on quality and price.  When I saw the deal on Amazon, I thought it would be low quality harmonicas, but they are good quality.", "id": 293}, {"review": "The harmonica barely fits the holder, and there is no adjustment for distance from the mouth to the harmonica. I can't get the harmonica adjusted close enough to play it, unless I modify it.", "id": 354}, {"review": "Good quality for the price. It exceeded my expectations.  I expected something a bit more flimsy, but was surprised to find it as heavy duty as it is.", "id": 422}, {"review": "It does a good job for the price.  I have a bad ear that distorts sounds somewhat, and this really helps.", "id": 706}, {"review": "I hooked up my mic and my guitar pickup and it sounds good.  I haven't had much chance to play it, but so far so good.  It seems like it is good quality.", "id": 734}, {"review": "Very handy,  I just slip this into the sound hole, hook it up to my amp, and then, when I finish playing, I slip it back out.  This is handy when I practice at night when my wife is sleeping.", "id": 789}]
