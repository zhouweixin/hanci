[{"review": "Works great for changing guitar strings. Good build and doesn't look cheap. Built-in string cutter and bridge pin remover is a plus.", "id": 94}, {"review": "Very soft gray microfiber cleaning cloth. Big and wide enough to handle any guitar. Works great for polishing and buffing guitar finish.", "id": 184}, {"review": "I wanted a black ukulele string to replace the stock strings for my yellow makala dolphin. These will work for soprano. The J53 is a good investment for under 6 bucks. They provide enough string to change your ukulele twice over and feels nice to play. Increases projection and tone to any stock strings. Not the best, not the worse strings, but an improvement.", "id": 203}, {"review": "Restored my rosewood fingerboard with a great color! Also works well on the bridge and only used a fraction of the bottle. A great investment that'll last quite a long time.", "id": 234}, {"review": "Took away my fingerprints and dust off my guitar and polished it to a shine that you couldn't see a reflection in yourself!", "id": 351}, {"review": "Love the colors and the price can't be beat. Wished maybe they came in yellow? Other than that, great picks.", "id": 574}, {"review": "Bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand. Mediums too hard on my thin fingers and will stick to light and extra light gauges. The strings were hard to slide, un-slippery, and changing barr chords made so much squeaks I didn't like. Tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes. G-string snapped 2 days later at the windings with the string wounds pried right off :\\", "id": 198}, {"review": "For 10 bucks it's a great piece. Works well on my acoustic guitar and acoustic bass. Battery IS included, but it is very small and almost lost it.", "id": 707}]
