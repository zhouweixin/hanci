YOu don't need anything else to have your guitar secured to the belt!", "id": 278}, {"review": "I don't know how this will work with other MIDI instruments but I tried it with the Roland TD9 drums and although it does transmit the data, the drum map is totally off. The respective triggers (hihat, hihat pedal, etc) are translated into all sorts of wrong information and while you can manually compensate for some of it on the PC end of it, it was just a freaking hassle. I needed this to be more flexible and able to record directly to my Notebook (which doesn't have a MIDI input) but I gave up in the end and went with my desktop PC and its MIDI interface.", "id": 565}, {"review": "This cable has a very cool vintage look and a perfect, clean sound. Absolutely love this! This is definitely recommendable.", "id": 587}, {"review": "This On Stage DA 100 Drum Stick holder works great and is super easy to attach. Looks good, feels good... don't know what else to write here to meet the review word count ;)", "id": 641}]
