[{"review": "I don't like that I have to continually tighten the knob at the back of the stand to keep the neck rest from tilting or moving and eventually falling down. The solution? Tighten the crap out of it with a wrench until you get it very snug and it won't budge.", "id": 133}, {"review": "Far too slippery for my fingers when I shredding and the tip wears out way too fast as well.", "id": 162}, {"review": "It sounds very artificial, I remember first getting this pedal and really loving the sound and kick it had, now that I use it with a better amp, it sounds very processed and artificial in sound that it's not even worth the price I payed for it before. I also had bought another one to replace the first one because the input section jack got messed up in the amp that it didn't want to lock with my guitar cable and when I took it apart, there was no way for me to fix it other than sending it to be replaced. Shitty pedal.", "id": 434}, {"review": "Super sturdy, well built. What more can I say, it's a sheet stand.", "id": 858}, {"review": "The cable died on me in less than a month. Very disappointed in built quality.", "id": 168}]
