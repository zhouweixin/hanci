[{"review": "Solid, stays where I put it, and does a great job holding a heavy mic, mount and pop filter. Can't really beat it for the price.", "id": 279}, {"review": "I was actually trying to buy the smaller Xenyx when I bought this one, but I'm so glad I got this model. Unbelievable amount of flexibility built into it. I use with the UCA202 audio interface and the Audio-Technica AT2035 for recording on my PC with Audacity every day since I unpacked it with no problems. Makes a perfect small studio combination!", "id": 370}, {"review": "You can spend a ton more for a studio-level, multi-channel interface, but all I wanted to do was get two analog channels in and two out (2x2) on my bargain-basement PC, and this fits the bill. Works perfectly with Audacity and Windows 7, plug and play.", "id": 384}, {"review": "Good quality cable. Actually much better than I expected for the price. I don't move around much, so I don't know about how rugged it would be out on the road, but the cable is flexible and should stand up to a lot of rolling and unrolling.", "id": 465}, {"review": "I've been in professional broadcast studios that don't have mics as nice as this one. Good flat response, but you can also click the bass roll off and get a little cleaner voice if you don't like to EQ after the fact. Sounds like a million bucks.", "id": 642}]
