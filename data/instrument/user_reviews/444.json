[{"review": "Excellent strings. Beautiful solid tone and no buzzing.", "id": 198}, {"review": "A bit wimpy, but so far they are holding up.", "id": 220}, {"review": "What a great little gizmo. I play both acoustic and electric guitar at my church and there is only one input on the board for me. No more unplugging/plugging in-between songs. Just a push on the pedal and I'm switching noiselessly between guitars. I can also adjust the input level for each guitar as well.", "id": 375}, {"review": "Fits nice and provides good protection.", "id": 865}, {"review": "Great precise tuning with the SN-2 versus the other Snark versions. I would only go with the SN-2. But...like all the Snarks, they are delicate where the head attaches at the ball joint. Treat it gently and find a hardshell plastic case in which to keep it and transport it or it will get smashed and break apart.", "id": 707}]
