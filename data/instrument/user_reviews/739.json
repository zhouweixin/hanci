[{"review": "Sweet little neck stand.  Very light weight.  Folds compact to fit in your guitar's hard case or gig bag.  Padded to protect guitar neck.", "id": 163}, {"review": "Apparently one can never have too many guitars, and with this stand you can keep three of them ready for immediate access.  Very stable.  The auto-locking heads rock!  Folds-up pretty compact for travel.  The optional carry bag is a must IMHO.", "id": 301}, {"review": "I buy these for my son.  He loves the grip on them as they help stop them from slipping out of his hands.  He also likes the small size.  They last forever and don't break.", "id": 686}, {"review": "These are great!  They're small.  Light weight.  Easy to read.  Accurate.  Inexpensive.  This one offers an additional feature:  Tap Tempo Metronome", "id": 707}, {"review": "I love these carry bags!  They allow me to easily carry multiple guitar stands, music stands, etc, all at once.  Who couldn't use an extra arm or two when moving equipment?  Well made and a fair price, too!", "id": 403}]
