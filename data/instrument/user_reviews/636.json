[{"review": "I had to make some adjustments on the neck of my Martin d-28 and remove the bridge pickup. This left the saddle too low to the neck.  I researched the \"Tusq\" products and found enough people impressed to give it a try.  I'm pleased to say I find more ring through the body and a better sustain.  I'll do this to my other acoustics as time goes on.", "id": 414}, {"review": "It is the dual tone shifter I was looking for.  Variable key capability. I haven't seen much more expensive ones with these features.  A Great buy for the money.", "id": 505}, {"review": "These help remove a lot of the clutter from the pedal board.  They snap in the way they should and appear to be of good quality.  Just what I'd expect from the company.", "id": 578}, {"review": "A bargain at the offered price.  Gives you virtually unlimited sustain.  It is a good cheap addition to my effects board.", "id": 645}, {"review": "This does some fairly cool things to the sound, but there is a lot more out there.  This would be great for a new person experimenting with effects", "id": 506}]
