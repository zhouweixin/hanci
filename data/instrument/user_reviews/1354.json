[{"review": "I bought these strings after buying some Elixir strings for my acoustic, which I was pretty happy with.  For my strat, however, these strings did not sound right from the start. After about a week I really started wondering if it was just in my head or if I really didn't have sustain that I thought I usually got from a new pair of strings.  I convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems, and I was right.  I put a pair of D'Addario XL 9.5 (highly recommended for those players who can't decide between 9s or 10s) and was amazed at how much tone and sustain I was losing with these Elixir strings.  I did feel like I could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings, but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently.  Don't let the higher price on these strings entice you, go with a good set of D'Addario or Ernie Ball strings for consistent long-lasting strings.", "id": 106}, {"review": "I bought these D'Addario strings after going back and forth between 9s and 10s and have really come to like these sizes.  They keep a nice, slinky feel and keep a lot of tone through many hours of playing.  I'm really happy with this D'Addario purchase!", "id": 196}, {"review": "These are my go-to acoustic strings.  They are a quality string with great sustain and clarity.  I bought Elixir Nanos to compare, and I did like them, but I think you get more clarity when chording or hammering on with these. I'll be sticking with these for the long run.", "id": 198}, {"review": "I put these on my ikea gorm board pedalboard and they work great so far.  No dead cables yet. I've been using them for 6 months or so.", "id": 805}, {"review": "Why not? For the price and some reviews I found online, I had to try this pedal.  I bought one myself and it has remained on my pedalboard since I've bought it.  NOTE : I recently put this right after my wah and before my dirt boxes and I've found that it does two things; 1. The vibe sound doesn't get smooshed and retains a more rounded sound and 2. any volume drop you might experience having this after some od/distortion seems to be less.  I suggest playing around and trying this pedal in different places on your pedal chain to see what works best for you.  For me, it will stay before my od pedals and fuzz.  Do yourself a favor and check out some youtube demos of this.  Mine is musicman587....this is the pedal AFTER pedals, but you'll get a good idea of the general settings I use it on.", "id": 551}]
