[{"review": "It sounds like it's Behringer.  Very fake, cheap sounding phaser, but it's all I need.  I got it mostly for that big airplane woosh, and running it in the loop, it does that fine.  The highs are kind of harsh, but if it is in front of the amp it can sound a little tame.", "id": 498}, {"review": "Doesn't wotk with V-Amp 3.  Doubt it works at all.  Red light always stays on and I've never seen the green light.", "id": 565}, {"review": "I thought it was my jack for a while, then I noticed it wouldn't stay in any pedal.  There is no \"click\" assuring that the cable is in place... and there's a reason for that, it isn't! Slips right out of every pedal I have.  Not reliable.", "id": 578}, {"review": "A loud hum will crescendo in every few minutes even if the ground is lifted.  Works great in intervals though, too bad those intervals are minutes.", "id": 606}, {"review": "This pedal makes my Les Paul sing.  Better than I imagined, even with all the good reviews.  Such a wide range of sounds; warm jazzy boost, great blues overdrive, and almost some Black Sabbath distortion.  Makes my crappy Behringer amp sound... almost good.", "id": 145}]
