[{"review": "After playing digital equipment for years I recently got into analog (pun intended) starting with an overdrive pedal.I had always heard a lot about the RAT and I wanted to try it out.I played a Boss DS1 at a store and thought it was a decent distortion but found it too trebly and thin.The Rat with all the knobs on 12 oclock sounds like a great rock amp. Like a perfect marshall but with more organic-ness. It really has its own tone I must add. Fat, thick, smooth and saturated. It responds to picking very well and organically.As you move the distortion knob higher, the sounds gets more and more animal. Very thick and \"furry\". The tone filter knob also is a very strong influence on the sound. With lower settngs the tone becomes more trebly and smooth and with higher settings it gets closer to fuzz. Very nice.A nice pedal to have to be sure.", "id": 232}, {"review": "Im a beginner. Good harps. Good solid sound.I cant bend at all so no idea if its just me.Youtube these, there's loads of videos.", "id": 293}, {"review": "This was the first time I ventured into the world of harp.I figured it out very easy and am pretty sure you will too.Fast shipping, no hassles.Thank you Amazon", "id": 354}, {"review": "I was amazed by the quality of construction of this item. It looks like it can put a dent in a car or break windows.The chrome on the sides looks very cool. Makes it look really smart.The battery installs easily by simply unscrewing the rubber feet at the bottom.The sound of this wah is pretty much exactly like Hendrix Clapton from the sixties. Its a wah and wah and does just that.I tried it on both clean and distorted sounds and it sounds great on both.I'm not sure if its a true bypass but I have a feeling it is. Because when its switched on without the battery there's no sound coming from it. Correct me if I\"m wrong.It's different sounding from the Crybaby wah. You should listen to both to know which is right for you. I wanted the \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" sound so I went with this.", "id": 451}, {"review": "I;ve ahd this cable pair for more than 2 years and have had no problems with them at all. I used them with both dynamic and condenser microphones.Here are their key points:+ Good quality construction.+ Secured heads.+ VERY long cable.+ NO signal problems.+ Overall great cable.+ Buy with confidence.", "id": 465}, {"review": "Perfect chain for most rock sounds.Get the 28 strand for a thicker snap.I might try out the 28strand next year. I'm pretty happy with this one right now.The place I live in has corrosive air though its not messed these chains.", "id": 526}, {"review": "I purchased these for my little pedal board \"The stepping stone\".THese are very well made with the heads well secured. The plastic is thick and of a nice material.The cables come with a massive 5 year warranty so I'm sure they're not going bad anytime soon.Buy with confidence.", "id": 578}, {"review": "I'll be brief and to the point here:+ Works as an audio interface for a line level signal. I used this with my Samson mixer.+ Is compact and the USB cable itself is long enough.+ The red color looks nice.+ Has a headphone out with volume control+ Plug and play. No extra drivers needed. I use ASIO anyways.+ Cheap. There's NO audio interface this affordable.+ Latency fairly low. Not bad.- Plastic body- RCA connectors. Not a big deal but wouldve been perfect if it had dual plugs or phono(1/4 inch).- 44.1 khz and 16 bit sampling. Should have been 24 bit and maybe 96khz. Even my DigiTech RP255 has a built in 24bit audio interface.", "id": 597}, {"review": "We've been using Remo heads for years on our kits for our band that plays everything from Classic rock to Speed Metal.Great quality, very durable.You can buy Remo heads with your eyes closed.", "id": 141}]
