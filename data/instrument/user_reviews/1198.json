[{"review": "Easy to pack, easy on the instrument, light weight but sturdy. An excellent value and a great gift idea too!", "id": 92}, {"review": "Be aware that when the boom is extended between the tripod stance that it can be a little tippy. Other than that,,,,,,,,,an excellent value", "id": 279}, {"review": "For the price these can't be beat. At this price it doesn't hurt to have a spare one or two on hand for the inevitable emergency", "id": 465}, {"review": "Very authentic sound reproduction. Simple to install but be aware that the instructions are not very clear. The threaded end is 'holed' so you can hook it with a wire to pull it into position on the tailstock. You'll never get your arm in there far enough. LOLYou will need a 15/32nd drill bit to complete the install.", "id": 611}, {"review": "Excellent mic, rugged with great sound and zero extraneous noise.Does not have an on/off switch which is a bit disappointing.", "id": 213}, {"review": "I've bought 3 capos in the last couple months searching for the perfect fit. Well, the hunt is over. Amazing tone, perfect tuning. I'm completely amazed with this capo........", "id": 761}, {"review": "If you're the kind of player that 'beats' on an acoustic like I do you'll find the sound hole pickup is an obstruction that you're constantly picking against causing loud clicks, pops and bangs.Very accurate pickup otherwise", "id": 789}, {"review": "I didn't like the arm through one part and your head through the other so I cut it apart and just hang my uke from my neck and the top of the sound hole. Works like a charm......is more easily adjusted and the felt lined sound hole clip has not damaged my uke at all.", "id": 824}]
