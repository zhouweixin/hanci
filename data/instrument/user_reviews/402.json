[{"review": "Good little connector cable.  Well constructed, durable, built to last.  I would recommend this cable to connect stomp boxes. Worth it.", "id": 11}, {"review": "The One Spot is a great way to supply power to all your stomp boxes without a bulky power supply or a bunch of wall warts.  Get it, you won't be sorry.", "id": 192}, {"review": "Works great.  For the money you can't go wrong with this effect.  I'm using it more then I thought I would when I first bought it.  The only thing I don't really care for is the stomp switch which is activated with more on a touch then a click.  Seems like it may be a weak point of the pedal but so far it's held up fine.", "id": 377}, {"review": "Works well, has many options of reverb and tweaks on all the options.  I would recommend this pedal for an inexpensive reverb.", "id": 508}, {"review": "Sounds great, easy to adjust.  Nice shape to help fit it on a compact pedal board. Worth price hands down.", "id": 791}, {"review": "Easy to use and only takes up one space on a power strip. Recommended.  Well worth the price of the product.", "id": 428}]
