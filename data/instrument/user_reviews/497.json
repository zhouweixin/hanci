[{"review": "I use it with an Audio Technica 2020, it work very well, the filter stays in place and it really improves the quality of the recording. Not much else to say.", "id": 46}, {"review": "I bought this stand a few months ago and it has held up quite well. For only $12.00 it is a steal, the stand is extremely sturdy and pretty heavy. I have used it with multiple mics such as the Audio Technica 2020 with the Samson SP01 shock-mount, a Rode K2, a Studio Projects C1 and a neumann TLM 103. I have not had any problems and the stand is heavy enough to use with basically any mic. I was not going to write a review for this product but I came across another review that stated \"I purchased this stand as people had reviewed this to work with a AT2020 with a SP01 shockmount. Mine must have been missing a part as it does not connect no matter what I try. \" THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. The Samson SP01 shock-mount works perfectly with this stand ( as any shock-mount or mic would, since the threading is a standard size). I just wanted to clear that up so that there would not be any confusion. Also almost every shock-mount has an adapter in the mount ( where the shock-mount connects to the mic stand) that is slightly smaller than most US mic stands, BUT THIS COMES OUT!! ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE A COIN AND UNSCREW IT FROM THE SHOCK-MOUNT. After the adapter is out the Samson SP01 will connect to this stand. I highly recommend this product.", "id": 224}, {"review": "I bought this as a gift for a friend he was really happy with it but, I have a completely different view. The AT2020 is a pretty bright mic which sounds good at first but once you layer tracks on top of each other it can sound very harsh. Second it is not a true large diaphragm condenser. It is a very good mic for people starting out in music or just using it for podcasts, but there are a bunch of better mics near this price. Two that come to mind are the MXL V67g and Studio projects B1 (stay away from the studio projects C1) both exceptional microphones for the price. Although there is one mic you that is a bit more expensive but is absolutely amazing, the MXL 2003a. A lot of people have claimed the studio projects C1 sounds like the Neumann u87 it doesn't, the MXL 2003a however sounds very similar and is easily the best LDC mic under $500. With that being said the AT2020 is not a bad microphone but it is not great, to people who have just used built in mics on there computer or camera this will blow them away but as time goes on they will learn the limitations of this microphone.Although to be fair I have a lot of experience in pro audio and production, so I maybe a bit overly critical. One thing is for sure though; there are definitely better mics in or near this price range.", "id": 254}, {"review": "I recently bought an Audio Technica 2020 and was looking for a shockmount for it, I bought the one that Audio Technica makes and I was not satisfied with the quality, so I returned it and came across the Samson SP01. My first thought was that it looked just like the shockmount I have for my Neumann TLM 103. I immediately purchased it after seeing that people were using it with the AT 2020. As soon as it arrived I put my AT 2020 in it and it looked stunning, after I mounted it on my on-desk mic stand I bumped the table a few times to see how it worked. In short it works great, The SP01 isolates the mic extremely well. I also tested the shockmount with my Studio Projects C1 and Rode k2 (both very heavy mics) and it works great. One word of advice it seems that some people are having problems hooking this shockmount to their mic stand ( which I find extremely amusing). Like most shockmounts the Samson SP01 has an adapter that is too small for most US mic stands already in the mount ( the part where the shockmount connects to the mic stand). THIS IS EASY TO REMOVE!! All you have to do is take a coin and unscrew it!! Once you unscrew the adapter the shockmount will connect to your stand.", "id": 393}, {"review": "I am completely blown away with these headphones. The second I got them in the mail I plugged it up to my mac pro, opened up itunes and played a song. Simply put it was amazing, I was able to hear EVERY single track individually! I later plugged the ATH-M50's into a Korg triton studio, recorded a session with some great microphones and edited a project in final cut all with the same results. The sound is so clear with these headphones you will notice every flaw no matter how small in whatever you are working on (which is a great thing). I have worked with a lot of headphones including some that cost many times what these do and I keep coming back. I have seen a few people comment that the bass is not \"punchy enough\" this is simply not true, the bass is amazing, any stronger and these headphones would not be true to the source. Make no mistake the ATH-M50's are extremely accurate and sound fantastic.", "id": 458}]
