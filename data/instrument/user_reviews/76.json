[{"review": "Base is heavy and sturdy so your mics won't topple over. But an arm on it and that could be a different story. The action on the height adjust was a little finicky for me but not enough for me to worry about. While I appreciate the weight of the base, I do kind of wish there was a lighter solution to keeping it stable with a heavy mic mounted on an angle.", "id": 224}, {"review": "While the product came as described, the build quality felt a little lacking. On the website it mentioned that it accepts the Shure KSM32 threading but it does not, so if you're threading matches the KSM32, look elsewhere.", "id": 393}, {"review": "Colors help keep track of what is going into where. And the build quality is solid. I was warned about the shielding but I haven't experienced an issues yet.", "id": 438}, {"review": "Lightweight, small, simple to use, and it's easy to read in broad daylight.Can't ask for much more in a tuner.", "id": 820}, {"review": "Not perfect but a solid stand. Prone to tipping over if you just toss your guitar onto it the way I do. And the bottom part that holds the guitar isn't fixed so it's good and bad. Good because it'll hand nearly and shape guitar at odd angles. Bad because if you just toss your guitar onto it the way I do, sometimes it just swings around annoyingly.", "id": 258}]
