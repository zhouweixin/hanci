[{"review": "Just trying to find a midi to midi was a task, and you have to make sure the pin config is correct.  This one is a good product and works just fine", "id": 4}, {"review": "Needed something to allow the strap on the guitar to be removed for ease of operation during playing.  This filled the bill, works on basically any type of guitar.

Amazon had it, and at a good price.", "id": 768}, {"review": "Wanted to hang my guitars on the wall.  These Hooks are padded, and rotate a little.  Provides a strong, non damaging support for some fine guitars.  The difficulty in installing was I wanted them to be screwed into a solid wall stud.  I had to attach them to a wood board, that I attached to the wall.  This also provided a additiional 3/4&#34; separation from the wall.  The guitars are less likely to bang on the wall.", "id": 779}, {"review": "Well made, XLR 3 pin adaptor to mini.
