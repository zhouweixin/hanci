[{"review": "My 1st Wah. This is going to take some getting used to regarding the switches, knobs, and buttons.  I am working on getting that nice way sound which I've come across somewhat.  It sounds funky when just strumming some simple cords. One thing I would have like would be to have some more detailed instructions about all of the functions it offers.  Behringer has never been very documentation oriented.", "id": 379}, {"review": "I have other Behringer products and have never encountered any issues operating them.  I use a power snake instead of batteries so I cannot comment on battery life or compartment access.  The box is plastic but that is not really a hinderence.", "id": 431}, {"review": "This workk well however I do get some residual noise that causes the meter to shift to to flat side of the range. I may need new cables.", "id": 443}, {"review": "I got this to eliminate all of the cords that powered the effects units as well as get something to house everything securely.  This board does the job for at least 6 pedals.  The Behringer pedals fit nicely into the foam slots and so far have not moved around during play. What I have to get used to is that the pedals are no longer against the floor, meaning that I not have to lift my foot higher to get over the boards edge to press them.  It should just take some getting used too.  One concern is that the linked power cables don't have anyplace to disappear into. I will be working on this. What I am not happy about is that the board is ALWAYS ON when plugged in.  The only way to shut off the power is to unplug it.  I wish it had a power switch.", "id": 616}, {"review": "I was initially wary of this as the cost was relatively low compared to other pedals however when I set it up and plugged it in I was truly amazed.  I now know what I was missing all those years of not having one.", "id": 645}, {"review": "I got this becasue our bassist got his hands on one and loved it.  I have a stompbox tuner but this Shark is really fantastic.Easy to use and very accurate.  It makes tuning a breeze.", "id": 706}, {"review": "What can one say about a cable?They are intended to transmit electrical impulse with the least amount in interference and this one does a superb job of just that.Why I have been thinking of replacing all of my other cables with additional cables just like this one, only slightly longer or a good deal shorter depending on the intended function.", "id": 168}]
