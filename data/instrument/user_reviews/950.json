[{"review": "Like the previous reviewer, I bought this to switch out the stock one that came in my mic preamp, and it just did wonders to warm the sound. Only problem is, now I am eyeing my amp, all it's tubes, and thinking... if one little adjustment made such a difference in a pre-amp, imagine what some of these will do in my fender! Sigh! Always something!Anyway, this is great! I am sure I will get more!", "id": 229}, {"review": "A friend of mine who is a guitar repair genus (and budding luthier) recommended this capo when I mentioned intonation problems with my guitar...I had always had some issues with it, but it was liveable. The real problem began when I switched to different strings- silk and steels. I  LOVED the tone I was now getting, but the intonation problems were suddenly much worse.What I had not considered, until my friend mentioned it, is that while my new strings provide the tonal warmth I was looking for, they are also easier to \"bend out of tune\". (Duh, I should have thought about this, it makes perfect sense in retrospect!) The capo I had been using was putting WAY too much pressure on the strings, and  greatly exacerbated the existing issue... one that will ultimately need to be taken in and repaired.So he mentioned this capo, and I immediately chortled. ($50 bucks? That's how much he payed. Yikes!)Then he grabbed his G7 from the car and let me try it. The strings stayed in tune! That's $350 on repair I can pocket for other things, at least for the time being. I was so impressed!I ordered one the next day.I am sure I will miss not being able to stick it on the usual perch when I am playing live, but it is really easy to use in general, and I won't look back. The intonation issues are greatly reduced, and I am thrilled.Worth every penny.", "id": 266}, {"review": "I have an Alvarez Yari acoustic guitar that I absolutely love. but I have wanted, missed a warmer tone (the body of this guitar is slightly smaller than many and I had always assumed that I would never be able to get the tone I wanted in the low end... as compared to the bass enhancing body of a typical dreadknot style of guitar, for example...).Then a friend recommended I try these strings, and, to my mind, my guitar has seen nothing short of a transformation!Here is the gorgeous tone I had missed!I am now on my second set of strings, and I am hooked.One thing: I have heard that these strings aren't as durable as other strings.However, this hasn't bothered me, as tend to finger-pick and soft strum, and so, this possibility hasn't become an issue for me.And while I would make no claim that everyone would have the great experience I did, I would wholeheartedly recommend trying these strings to anyone looking for a variation in tone.The fact that it is easier on the fingers is another reason to give these a try! Thumbs up!", "id": 409}, {"review": "... but not great either. The \"needle\" never seemed to stay still long enough to isolate the pitch. It also appears that the tuner wasn't reliable on the pitch end either. Recently ordered the red SNARK tuner here on Amazon, and I think it's much better- the Intelli does have the fact that it folds down snug against my guitar going for it- the snark is a little more bulky.Ultimately, the most important thing for me when it comes to tuners is accurate pitch, and readability- Snark wins out... this tuner works for sure, but I don't think it's the best out there.The Snark is cheaper too!", "id": 635}, {"review": "UPDATE: 15 July 2013I still really love how these assist in quick tuning, but MAN, are they FLIMSY.All of my other musician friends- who also LOVE this tuner's ability to grab the right pitch- also have employed copious amounts of super glue to re-attach the neck and clip to the body of the tuner.So, in short, this is a mixed bag. I would rate the abilities of the actual tuner at somewhere over 6 stars- EASILY my favorite ever in this capacity... combined with the absolutely DEPLORABLE build quality of the clip itself.Sigh.It's such a bummer to rave about a product to your friends... only to follow it with the obligatory disclaimer.If SNARK fixes the problem, I would instantly bring the rating back up to my original 5 star rating... but until then...and I LOVE this tuner... 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3.Boo.(ORIGINAL REVIEW)I have had similar tuners in the past... and by similar, I mean clip on...Nearly every other tuner I have had has not maintained a reading, which translated into what felt like a game of keep away, where I was the frustrated kid in the middle who could never quite catch the pitch.I am willing to bet that lots of folks have had this experience with many tuners. Not only that, but many of these tuners run upwards of twenty bucks, if not more.So I was skeptical. But so many high reviews couldn't be wrong, and for the price I figured it was a fairly risk free gamble.Really glad I tried it out!The screen is clear and easy to read, and the pitch indicator holds steady in one spot. No more chasing pitch for me!Haven't needed to use the vibration/ mic option yet, but I am sure that will come in handy at some point.Planning on getting another one for my other instruments as well.Definitely recommended!", "id": 707}]
