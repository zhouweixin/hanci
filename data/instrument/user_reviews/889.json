[{"review": "Very good cable. Well made and it looks great with my Candy Apple Red Tele. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because it tends not to lay flat on the floor.", "id": 3}, {"review": "These trees came in Fender packaging and fit just as the old ones did and look the same. They have the same locating pin in front of the screw and are the finishing touch in refurbishing my guitar.", "id": 115}, {"review": "These locks are the only ones I use now, they are on all of my guitars and I put them on all I build. I have not had a guitar drop since I started using them, and have not read of anyone else having one drop either if it was attached. I have tried the Fender lock recently and although it is a great lock it is too large for me and my Schaller equipped straps will not fit them. I will stick with the Schaller in all 3 colors.", "id": 278}, {"review": "I bought this new Fender F neck plate to replace the plain one I had on one of my MIM Strats. but at this time I am not sure I like what I have done. It appears a little thinner than the original and just doesn't look as &#34;original&#34;.", "id": 475}, {"review": "These are the same strings I paid much more for in my store. The are the same as came on my Guitar. Work and sound great.", "id": 667}, {"review": "I gave this strap lock a 4 star only because it is too large for me and is not interchangeable with all of my Schaller locks. It is a great lock and works fine, but is not for me.", "id": 682}, {"review": "Works as advertised for polishing my guitars. I don't use any other cleaners such as Fender Polish when I use this cloth.", "id": 184}, {"review": "I bought these black locks to go on a black Stratocaster I built. I don't use any strap locks but Schallers on any of my guitars or any that I build. I recently bought some Fender locks that worked fine but were too large for me and all of my existing straps wouldn't fit them.", "id": 277}]
