[{"review": "Switches channels on my Mustang II like a charm. Would have received a 5-star rating had it been in a metal enclosure. It is plastic, but it suits my needs.", "id": 563}, {"review": "Very nice quality of leather. It's just a little bit short for my taste. The guitar rested too high for my liking. With some creative engineering I was able to get it to the length I needed.", "id": 632}, {"review": "Nice straplock system! Very easy to install as compared to other systems. The system is a secure locking system. This is my favorite locking system I have in my arsenal.", "id": 682}, {"review": "With a little sanding, this fit my Fender American Strat perfectly. Great sound that only a bone nut can produce. My strings stay in tune even better with this installed. Very nice value!", "id": 857}, {"review": "Perfect retrofit for my 1989 American Strat. The locking mechanism is strong. No problems at all. I like to stay brand loyal, so I honestly think these tuners will go on the rest of my Fender collection. Tuning is a breeze and is very stable.", "id": 387}]
