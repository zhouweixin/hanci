The sound of these strings is different than any other strings you could get. They also teach a guitar player to use a lighter touch while playing to produce beautiful sounds. Well worth it.", "id": 28}, {"review": "This is another useful item from Planet Waves for the guitar player. This winder saves time,especially when you are anxious to get back to playing after breaking a string or replacing every string.This is not bulky & fits into several different guitar cases without taking up much room. Worth the price.", "id": 94}, {"review": "WOW, is putting it mildly when you here the quality sound that these strings produce on a 12 string.Endless beauty when you here the tones produced by Elixer. Elixer strings are more expensive than other strings but well worth the higher price tag. You can not go go with a set or two of Elixers.", "id": 110}, {"review": "A guitar player can never have enough of these things around. These picks hold up well & that says alot because I am not easy on picks if any kind.", "id": 120}, {"review": "Great addition to a guitar pickers bag of tricks. It does hold plenty of picks for a gig or practice.

This is one of the easiest to use slides that I have ever owned & I have been playing for about 45 years. I play mostly classic rock & this slide is a handy gadget to have in your guitar case.This holds up very well because I have a way of abusing a slide. Dunlop does it again.", "id": 456}, {"review": "One of the best & accurate tuners that I have ever used.
