[{"review": "I got this pedal recently.  All in all, it's a pretty nice device, expecially for the price.  Seems solid and well-made.  It has a nice big pedal for big feet.  It works smoothly.  I have found no drawbacks to the operation or quality of this pedal.  My only gripe, is that the power for the pedal is either by an internal 9V battery, or a 12V plug in power supply.  Why the difference?  The really bad part (for me) is that I bought this to install in a newly-purchased Behringer pedal board, which comes with a 9V power supply.  So, in order for me to use this pedal in the board, I will have to run two different power supplies, or run the pedal on battery and everything else off of the pedalboard's power supply.  [Behringer...this was not thought out very well.]  I'm now in the process of making myself an voltage adapter, but finding all the right parts has proven so far to be a hassle.  Bottom line:  the pedal itself is great, but the power supply thing could be a frustration to you.One final note about Behringer...they seem to get bad marks now and then.  I really don't understand why.  I have two Behringer amps, two of their stomp boxes, the above-mentioned pedal board, and the volume pedal just discussed.  I really like all of them.  I have never had any problem with any of these items.  They perform well, are well made, and certainly, all came at a reasonable price.  Behringer's full range of products is so extensive, that I see little reason to buy any other brand.  I'm sticking with them.", "id": 212}, {"review": "I've used the FX600 for a couple of years.  I've got a pedal board, with several pedals, but if I had to take only one pedal with me, (and I often do, when I have to travel lite), this is the pedal I take.  Not only do I get a full selection of effects, but the pedal doubles as a DI unit, solving input issues on some problem sound systems I've played thru.  That's probably an unintended benefit, but I find it a valuable feature, which gives me confidence to play thru any system.  FYI, my buddy's Digitech multi-effect pedal actually introduces hum into systems, where this (FX600) has helped me get a cleaner sound.  While this unit has no tone adjustments, it also adds 'something' to make my guitars sound better (I know that is sort of vague).  The only down side of this pedal that I have found is that, because they have jammed so much stuff into one pedal, it is a little hard to make precise adjustments.  But, with what this pedal DOES do for me, that's a small price to pay.  For this price, I can't see why anyone would not like this pedal.", "id": 430}, {"review": "I've owned several multi-effect pedals in the past, even one Digitech.  Up til now, they all had one thing in common: layers of menus to click thru to make any changes or adjustments.  It was a pain.  Then I saw this one...with KNOBS! I did a lot of research, and was torn between the RP255 and the RP355. I decided to go cheap and got the RP255.  So far, that was an OK decision.  The RP255 has plenty of features, and is a good compromise between menus and knobs.  I recommend reviewing the manual for your first day or two of orientation.To sum up the device quickly, the RP255 is probably capable of generating any sound or effect you want, but you may need to work at it.  As with many multi-effect pedals, there is a selection of (60) factory tone/effect profiles, to save you the trouble of programming new ones.  These are mirrored by 60 \"user-defined\" profiles, which are identical to the factory presets.  The difference is that #1-60, can be modified by the user, or left as-is.  The factory presets, # 61-120, are not modifiable.  So, you can really experiment with different setups without worrying about losing what came from the factory.  You can also \"reset\" the entire device if you want to, but if you do you will lose all of your modifications.In addition to all the different tones and effects this unit has to offer, there are also two additional features which are very useful: a (pretty basic)drum machine and a 20 second looper.  The looper is really why I bought this pedal.  It's easy to use, and it overdubs.  I only wish Digitech would have made it a 40 or 60 second looper.  20 seconds really isn't much.  FYI, you cannot use the drummer and the looper at the same time.  No biggie for me.OK, all that's good, so why am I disappointed in this unit?  Pretty simple.  I'm an older guy, who has been playing for approximately 50 years.  I've played every kind of music there is, and I would have appreciated a much broader selection of presets.  This may be a slight exageration, but it seems like 95% of the presets are some sort of (obnoxious) distortion.  Come on guys, not all of your customers are 13 years old!  I expect a professional piece of equipment to offer a variety of professional choices.  Now, I'm faced with working out all of my own presets.  I'm back to programming menus again, ugh!.So that's about it.  It's a solid piece of equipment, with too many juvenile tone presets to choose from.  In all honesty, if I had been aware of this, I would have probably not gotten this unit, inspite of its good design and quality.", "id": 590}, {"review": "I have owned just about every tuner made.  They all had pluses and minuses.  I like this one a lot.  It is my tuner of choice right now.  The backlit screen is great and the tuner is accurate.  It is also small, which I appreciate.  For this price ($15) you simply can't go wrong.", "id": 635}, {"review": "I own one of these amps and it is capable of everything from very clean to heavy over-drive. I love it. It's got tone galore! I play either a Martin A/E thru it or a Strat knock-off.  Either one sounds awesome.  Never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp, let alone for $20. Battery life seems OK, but I hate messing with batteries, so I'd buy power supply (you can get a 9V supply (check for proper polarity) at the Thrift store for a buck).  Don't even think about it.  Get it.  $20 is pocket change.", "id": 303}, {"review": "I already had two Behringer stompboxes, and am thinking of adding a few more, so I thought rather than having a mess on the stage, I'd get a pedalboard.  I hadn't really studied them too much, except to note that they all seemed to be way more money than they were worth.  Then, recently I found this one for less than a hundred bucks, so I really couldn't pass it up.  I am very impressed with this unit.  It is well made, well designed, and comes with all sorts of cords and accessories.  Nothing is lacking to start playing right away.  I'm not sure how easy other brands stompboxes will fit into this board (you may need to trim the foam that holds them in a little bit), but I think the board should be pretty universal for whatever you have.  I am not disappointed in the least.  I think you will like this board.", "id": 616}]
