[{"review": "This tool has high marks for one reason: It works. This is the best at combining two tools into one. Give it high marks for form and function. Love it.", "id": 94}, {"review": "It had been a while since I had some EB's. Best packaging I have seen and for the price, don't order just one pack. Very pleased, always have a spare pair in your case.", "id": 226}, {"review": "Picked up some Blue Steel lite stings and some brass abalone pins to enhance tone. Also was the last to pick it up for $118.50 shipped to my door. If you like a parlor guitar, this might be for you. The case is kick ass too, easily a $50 value.Update: After putting on the brass pins and adding a snark tuner, along with putting on new strings, this guitar rocks. Putting the brass pins keeps it from being too top heavy and helps to improve tone. This is my go-to guitar. Sounds good and has great intonation. The only fore-seeable upgrade would be to get closed geared tunners but the open geared work fine and hold tunning. I have a washburn D-30 and love this just as much for 1/3 the cost.", "id": 252}, {"review": "Awesome for $10. Accurate with TV on in the background. This thing is just sweet, I just love it. Easy no-brainer.", "id": 762}, {"review": "This does what it says it does. Anything is better than the rubber plug that was in the soundhole. This is easy to install, I just losened the strings and inserted the o port. My Washburn D-30S will never leave home without one.", "id": 704}]
