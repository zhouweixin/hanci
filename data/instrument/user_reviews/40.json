[{"review": "This little gem is worth it's weight in gold!  So easy to tune with it.  We have used it seemingly zillions of times and the battery is still going strong.  Automatic  shut-off helps too.", "id": 763}, {"review": "My hubby and I decided we wanted to learn to play the uke, so we ordered this set based on decent reviews.  Wonderful.  We learned to play thanks to this kit.  While the instrument itself certainly isn't of high quality, it is more than adequate and has a good sound.  The real jewel in the crown 'tho is the instruction book.  Fab! It is highly informative, easy to follow, and has some good songs in it.  I still use it for reference and do not pick up my uke without that book nearby.", "id": 766}, {"review": "Just like the ones in the store.  We mounted our two ukes on these.  Put our hangers in studs, but they come with those plastic gizmos for drywall.  Heavy duty and nice looking.  Great price.  You just can't beat the speed and convenience of Amazon.", "id": 788}, {"review": "What a good buy!  This gig bag is nicely made, looks great, and the padding is really nice.  Luv the zip pocket in the front - perfect for strap, snark, capo, whatever.  Bought this for my hubby's tenor uke and one just like it ('tho smaller)for my concert uke.  Highly recommend.", "id": 845}, {"review": "This is such a nice bag for the price.  Nicely padded with an ample zip compartment that can hold your snark, capo, or whatever.  There is a handle and a shoulder strap.  Plus, it is reallly a nice looking bag, black with a little white trim in front.", "id": 43}]
