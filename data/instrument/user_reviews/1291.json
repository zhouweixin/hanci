[{"review": "I bought this just to see if I might enjoy learning or if my shoulders (I'm gettin' old...lol)would allow me to hold the correct position long enough to practice.  I wouldn't say it's agreat instrument but WAY more than I expected for $60.  After I changed the strings,(I used the extra set that came with it) it actually produced decent sound.  I bought anew bow (for &#62;$100, so...) and found I like the one that came with it at least as much.The case is excellent...I'll prob use it with my upgrade.So for the price, you really get far more than you pay for.p.s.- the shoulder rest is kinda useless though.", "id": 596}, {"review": "This is an all metal (exc. for the adjusting screw) stand, full-sizedfor 20 bucks.

Maybe I'm using it wrong but Ihave trouble finding anywhere to clip it but my pegs.  But from there it works great,just have to work to find a peg at the right position to afford a  good angle.", "id": 811}, {"review": "My only criticism is that for the size of the screen the readout is reallysmall and a bit hard for an old blind man like myself to see.", "id": 330}]
