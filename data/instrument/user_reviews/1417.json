[{"review": "I have one of these on my guitar and one on my ukulele. I can't imagine life without this pick holder -- before I was always losing picks and then I had to strum with my fingers which I don't like doing. Get one of these if you play with a pick!", "id": 233}, {"review": "I've been using this bench regularly since ordering it in 2011. It's great in all ways but one: The rubber feet constantly fall off. If you use this bench regularly, the floor in your playing area will always be littered with rubber feet.Solution: UseGorilla Glue Epoxyor a similar superglue to firmly attach the feet to the bench. This is what I have done and now I have no problem with wandering feet. On Stage should consider doing this in the factory to save you the trouble.", "id": 362}, {"review": "Fantastic sound -- just trust what everyone on here is saying -- if you buy these strings and slap em on a cheap ukulele, you will have bought yourself hundreds of hours of playing and fun!", "id": 698}, {"review": "Like the other one star reviewers -- my problem is that the head broke off. I tried to glue it back on, but it just fell apart even worse when I tried to do that. If you buy this, you really need to baby it! My advice is look for a more sturdy model!", "id": 706}, {"review": "This is a very sturdy and well-made bag. Much better for the money than I was expecting. I wish I could find a guitar bag that was this nice! My uke is very cozy inside. The pocket on the outside has a lot of space for your picks, kazoo, ukulele stand, whatever you need to have with you.I carry an iPad around when I play -- the full size iPad doesn't fit in the outer pocket, so I put it on the back of the uke on the inside. An iPad Mini would probably fit.", "id": 845}, {"review": "not as much padding as I would like. my old bag had more. other than that I like the pockets and overall design.", "id": 865}, {"review": "This thing is TINY and does not have the breakable swivel head of the original snark. This is the only tuner you need!", "id": 893}, {"review": "This stand holds up my ukulele, so yay. Folded up, it fits perfectly inside the side pocket in the Hola gig bag, which I also use and heartily recommend. Make no mistake - this stand is not pretty, it feels and looks like cheap plastic, but it does the job.", "id": 881}]
