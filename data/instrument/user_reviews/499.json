[{"review": "Does the job, i've had this for about 7 months and it hasn't let me down yet...except for that time I couldnt find it. The winder, the cutter and the pin-pull all work well enough. Noted,  I've only used it to cut Elixir Nanoweb strings and nylon strings and they more on the soft side compared to regular steel strings.", "id": 94}, {"review": "Polyweb strings have a heavier coating so I prefer nanoweb for the ultra-thin coat and brighter sound. They're easy on my fingers and make the most beautiful sound. Because they're coated and have anti-rust, they last up to months longer than regular strings and don't make much finger sounds. Favorite strings.", "id": 295}, {"review": "I'm a beginner guitar player going on intermediate and I've quickly learned that anything from Jim Dunlop is quality stuff.", "id": 455}, {"review": "The grip on these is pretty great, I haven't dropped them at all and I've been playing so much better. They give a nice crisp sound with my Elixir nanoweb strings.", "id": 503}, {"review": "The item came quickly and as decribed. It clamps on my acoustic just fine, no string buzz or damage to the neck so far.", "id": 603}, {"review": "I have no complaints except when I try to tune my guitar a half step down, there are buttons for that on the back of the tuner but I have zero clue how to use them. This tuner is perfect it sits nicely on the head, swiveling head, visible from wherever you are.", "id": 706}, {"review": "I had the SN1 Guitar Tuner, this one the SN2 is actually for all instruments if I'm not mistaken and it works great. Never fails. I love the red, the swivel head, the green.red lights when tuning. Just remember to take it off the headstock when youre done using it", "id": 707}]
