[{"review": "I am very pleased with this purchase. The strings play very clearly with zero buzzing on any position between frets. I can dramatically hear and feel the difference than when I used a cheap $5 capo before. This is well worth your pay :)", "id": 26}, {"review": "As old strings slowly start to stretch and wear out, you hardly notice the sound quality deteriorate. But it's important to replace them every month or two, even if you hear no problem with the current strings. Playing on fresh strings is the best experience ever!These Blue Steel light strings sound like gold. The crisp and solid vibration is just top notch! Probably better than any other light strings I've bought. They needed to be tuned often before they settled in, but all new strings do. I haven't used them long enough to give a review on how well they hold up, but I'll be updating in a month or so. So far, they are great. Definitely recommended!", "id": 204}, {"review": "This is a great case that came TWO WEEKS earlier than the arrival date. In came in good packaging and I found no flaws when inspecting it. My Jasmine fits snugly inside of it, no bumping whenever I carry the case. The only problem I have is it smells terrible! But that's fine; I just left it open on the deck for two days and the smell is not noticeable. Other than that, this was a great investment!", "id": 540}, {"review": "I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar, it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately, and you would be more likely give up. This, on the other hand, is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments, this included. It plays very loud and clear, zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else, look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case, So I bought this one here, that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)", "id": 148}, {"review": "This is a perfect strap for my guitar. It's not rough on my neck and is very adjustable. It's very simple and is perfect for me. I'm very pleased with this purchase.", "id": 479}]
