I bought this one for its adjustability.", "id": 74}, {"review": "If you're into playing blues, these strings have great tone and due to being a light guage, they allow you to bend the strigs easier.  I'm not a working musician and only play for my own enjoyment, but I'd use these anywhere.", "id": 156}, {"review": "I have other harmonica's but thought I'd like a set of blues harps.  I thought that if it's made by Hohner, it must be fairly good.  Wow, was I wrong.  Too hard to push notes through them.  I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.", "id": 293}, {"review": "One for each guitar and they are heavy duty and work great.  I probably didn't need the 15' length, but at the time, this was the only really good cable with 90* angles.", "id": 419}, {"review": "I ordered this as a spare and at this time, I haven't used it.  My microphone came with it's own cable and this was for a &#34;What if&#34; situation.  I gave it 4 stars on just expectation.", "id": 465}, {"review": "I don't use these alot, but when I play jazz style music or ballads, they work better without playing with heavy attack and give a more mellow tone to the solo's.", "id": 686}, {"review": "As you can tell by the title, I've got another of these little babies.  Snark improved the readabilty and the new one is bright, clear and works great.", "id": 724}]
