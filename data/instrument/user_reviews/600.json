[{"review": "I love the pick attack with these.  I have used almost everything out there over 20 years of playing and have settled on this pick as my go-to choice for acoustic guitar.", "id": 54}, {"review": "It's a Fender Heavy so there's not much else to say about that.  Good price and selection here.  Go for it.", "id": 120}, {"review": "Fender Heavies, what more needs to be said?  Great price for the quantity.  Just buy it so you don't have to worry about losing a pick or storing extras around various places.", "id": 332}, {"review": "No other choice on the market IMHO.  This is the one to get.  I have two and would buy again if I needed another one.", "id": 504}, {"review": "I was a little nervous for some reason when I started watching this (I saw it in the theatre).  I was afraid I might be in for another Live Aid let down or something like that.  I had heard the epic reviews and the internet buzz when the actual event happened...but had no idea if this would be as good as all that.  Never fear, you need to see this film.  The guys prove that the hype was legit.  I was so stoked when they launched in to some of my faves like \"For Your Life\" even if the performances of \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"Stairway\" seemed a little pedestrian.  But hey, it's LZ doing Stairway which is better than 99% of the music on the planet so who cares if it was an obligatory performance?  The show seems to get better as it goes along, and by the time \"Kashmir\" comes on I had tears in my eyes.  No joke.  This show is riveting.  I bought the Blu-Ray so I could continue to experience the awesomeness of this show, which really defies description.  I am not sure if non-LZ fans can appreciate how incredible this show is, or what the band accomplished in doing this.  They took it seriously and rehearsed for 7 weeks for this one event.  Jason Bonham did a good job of honoring his father and staying true to the original material and live nuances developed over multiple tours in the 70's.  If you love LZ you probably already have this set, if you have a passing interest only you will witness a one-night-only reunion that blows away any of the other weak attempts by older bands of this era.  It's pretty awesome.", "id": 855}]
