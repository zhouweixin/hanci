[{"review": "This is one awesome guitar!  I also purchased the Fender Mustang I Amp, Epiphone custom case (fits like a glove) and Planet Waves Planet Lock Leather Guitar Strap (comfortable and very secure) which made for an UNBELIEVEABLE combination along with Rocksmith 2014.  I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this combination.  The only problem in my household is....who gets to play next.", "id": 30}, {"review": "Totally perfect for holding my guitar!  Super sturdy, easy to put in/take out!  Wide enough stance that you don't have to worry about it falling over on carpet!", "id": 133}, {"review": "Originally put-off by the low price, I went with the reviews.  Simply AWESOME!  This amp is packed with features.  Beginner/Intermediate level player would be very pleased!  The best part is, it's not at all complex to learn the features.", "id": 718}, {"review": "I could not believe the quality of this case, fits my Epiphone Les Paul 100 like a glove.  Very plush interior, plenty of storage and very durable.", "id": 50}, {"review": "This strap is perfect!  It locks on your pins, no worry about sudden disconnects and is comfortable (it's not padded).  Highly recommend!", "id": 666}]
