[{"review": "It does the job it was intended to do. Before using this I just hooked the strap to the buttons and didn't like it. To confined, and with the quick release, it was more comfortable to use the strap. I'm glad I purchased this when I did.", "id": 174}, {"review": "I thought it was a good deal when I saw the original price, the discount stated it was $8 off. Instead it was only $2 cheaper than buying at my local music store. Other than the price, the strings work great on my guitar. Sounds amazing. I'll definitely be buying more of these.", "id": 198}, {"review": "I purchased this to replace my other adapter that didn't work. Whereas, this does the job. I'm happy I purchased this and didn't have to invest in purchasing 9V batteries every time I wanted to play guitar.", "id": 760}, {"review": "Does what it was intended to do. Completely satisfied with this purchase. Seems to work just fine for my needs.", "id": 762}, {"review": "I didn't want to spend too much $$ for a guitar that I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. There were a few at the local music store but 3 times the price. They were good quality and if this didn't work out then I would have probably gone that route. To my surprise, this guitar exceeds all my expectations for an acoustic guitar. The only downfall was that the frets were sharp on the one side of the guitar. The local shop only charged me $5 to shave them down. I replaced the strings right away. I'm completely satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it. Definitely worth the price you pay.", "id": 183}, {"review": "I bought this during the Black Friday sale. The price was right, since if I was dissatisfied then I wouldn't be out that much money.Quality product. Well worth the purchase. I would recommend this.", "id": 208}, {"review": "I'm happy with this purchase. I bought it during the Black Friday sale. It works for what I use it for. When not in use, it just gets put away. Doesn't take a lot of space.", "id": 304}]
