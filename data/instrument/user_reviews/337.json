[{"review": "A value and a half. If you need a beater this is it. It plays great,  great fret job and solid tone. Have recommended to several students. This guitar pays better than some 3 times is value!", "id": 183}, {"review": "I am a professional touring and recording artist, OMEB, who typically sings through a beta 58. I have recently been very impressed with some of Behringer's products. Sometimes I will run sound for local festivals and needed a few extra vocal mics. I had read a few good reviews of this and decided to buy one. At $25 I figured I could chance it! I used this in place of my beta 58 at a recent show. The mic was much hotter than the 58, better bass response and the boosted highs in all the right frequencies! As far as durability... that is the question, but if you are looking for a great mic that doesn't cost $160 bucks... this is your mic!", "id": 213}, {"review": "I needed a few extra cables this year for a few live sound events. For the price point I was worried about buying \"cheap cables\". This are a great value for your buck. The only thing I didn't like about these... the cable ties suck! haha... If you need some quality \"cheap\" cable, these are for you!", "id": 423}, {"review": "Very bright! 4 of them are great for lighting up the front stage of a band which is my application for them! Worth the money!", "id": 534}, {"review": "I purchased this to help unclutter my desk with some of my recording gear. This stand is very stable and useful! So if you want a cheap way to rack your stuff this is the way to go!", "id": 322}]
