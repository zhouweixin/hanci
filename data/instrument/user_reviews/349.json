[{"review": "These picks are nice and thin, just what I was looking for in a pick.  They seem durable so far and the light color makes them easy to see when you drop one or set it down.  I'm satisfied with these picks.", "id": 63}, {"review": "Works great, seems durable, shipped fast.  Can't think of a single negative thing about this product.  If you need a tuner, this ones a good one.", "id": 707}, {"review": "Good design, easy to hang on to these picks.  Reasonable price makes it even better.  I don't often use picks, but when I do, I use these.  I will buy more in the future.", "id": 792}, {"review": "I like the capo, only it seems a little stiff when opening it up to put it on or take it off.  It was actually a bronze color instead of gold, but that's not a big deal to me.  I'm interested on the durability of this, but for the price, how can you go wrong?", "id": 839}, {"review": "I've used several different kinds of strings over several years playing. I'm no expert, but these strings sound good to me.  Subtle differences with different styles of strings, so its a preference thing.  If you havent tried em, they're worth a shot.", "id": 225}, {"review": "Bought these for my friend, he asked for these exact strings.  His guitar always sounds awesome, and I always ask his advice for musical products.  I even sound OK when I play his guitar, so I say try em out.", "id": 227}, {"review": "Great deal on a capo, it's about the same quality as one i would buy for 5x the amount elsewhere.  It takes a while for the shipping, but that's stated in the description.  I was pleasantly suprised.  I would recommend this capo.", "id": 802}]
