[{"review": "I've been trying to find a pick which combines a good grip, the right string resonance for strumming, and enough stiffness for accurate picking and these picks might be the closest I've found so far for my style of playing. I'm a naturally hard strummer so I want a pick that I can hold more loosely, strum more softly, and still get enough clarity and volume. I want to give them 5 stars but I think that would only apply if they were perfect for strumming and picking - they're very good for both but not quite what I would consider the ideal pick for me if one exists. If I were perfectly satisfied with these picks I would never buy any other picks. For now these are my preferred picks but I will keep experimenting with other brands and types of picks in search of that elusive ideal.", "id": 65}, {"review": "These guitar strings sound about the same after a month of playing as they do right after I change them. I use to get a real kick out of changing strings because the new strings sounded so much different and better, but now the thrill is gone because these strings sound good for a couple of months although I change once a month anyway. I don't notice much difference at all though.But the best part is that these strings are over $17 bucks a set at my local music store and I get 'em for about $9.48 through Amazon's subscription service delivered to my mailbox every month with free shipping! Beat that!", "id": 130}, {"review": "For the price and free shipping, this can't be beat. It's heavy weight, solid construction, and very stable. Pay attention to the warnings. If your guitar has polypropylene finish, which most do, you're going to be fine. If you have a very high end guitar, this might not work.", "id": 601}, {"review": "These picks do have a nice grip, but they deaden the sustain on the guitar considerably. They just aren't quite my cup of tea.", "id": 680}, {"review": "This little dude does a great job. The clip works great on my music stand and the light itself has a bright display and a dimmer display to save batteries. I highly recommend. I can sit in a completely dark room and see the music fine!", "id": 827}, {"review": "These picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar. I don't like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups, etc. Big disappointment. I'm getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem. Back to the drawing board I go.", "id": 245}]
