[{"review": "Good strong spring and good strong materials.  The only improvement I would make is the clear protector that holds behind the neck.  The protector needs to be longer.

If it had more surface extended from end to the base where it pivots it would help.", "id": 26}, {"review": "Since they were named &#34;Gator Grip&#34; I expected them to have a good gripping surface.  That was not the case.  The entire material and holding surface is the same material.  Also they weren't as large as I expected.  They are still usable as decent picks.", "id": 65}, {"review": "Elixir strings are great for me.  They hold their tones longer.  They aren't rough textured so they are easier on the fingers.", "id": 103}, {"review": "Puts on a good shine for your instrument.  I like the spray bottle applicator.  You can even apply a shine to the fingerboard area underneath the strings.", "id": 351}, {"review": "Easy to use.  I can tune while in a sea of people or other musical background.
