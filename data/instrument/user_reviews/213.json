[{"review": "The only complaint I have about this is that there's no clip on the back to hang it from so as to keep from knocking it over. This probably doesn't matter to all of y'all though. Other than that, it's a very nice machine with a flashing light and two &#34;click&#34; options. Easy to use and quality built.  ~Pegleg~", "id": 390}, {"review": "Steady and stable with the lip to hold material without slipping off when turning pages and deep enough to set my metronome on it too. Easily adjustable, good finish, solid, much more stable than the folding ones. Just what I need.", "id": 696}, {"review": "This is a good guitar for the price. Played well right out of the box. The finish is beautiful and I found no defects. Sounds good and well worth the money.", "id": 754}, {"review": "This is more of a toy than a good pickup. It functions but doesn't sound great. What did I want for this price anyway?", "id": 759}, {"review": "This is a good product. These work very well and are inexpensive and easy enough to put on. I like.", "id": 871}]
