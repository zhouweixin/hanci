[{"review": "For the price, this is one of the best pop filters. It easily clamps onto my stand and doesn't move around after I place it. However, there is one problem I've had with it. It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter. What I mean is that, if I pick up the mic, the arm will swivel away. Granted this was caused by me dropping it once, but before it was fine. So for a good price you get a filter that works.", "id": 46}, {"review": "Use this for my desk mic at home. It hold my mic right where I want it and doesn't move from where I place it. Worth every penny and then some.", "id": 224}, {"review": "Works exceedingly well for any use. Whether dubbing audio, recording instruments, or just yelling at the top of your lungs. No issues and pretty sure I will never have any.", "id": 254}, {"review": "This transfers my XLR mic to my USB laptop. Simply plug it in and find the right drivers. My only issue is that the device would be better if they made it with a more durable plastic. It does seem like it can break easily. Thankfully I will never have to move it around much on my desk. All in all, it works and I am pleased.", "id": 538}, {"review": "I use this for my desk mic I use for recording. It is the perfect length and the connectors are of excellent quality, especially for this price. Definitely would buy these again for other mics in the future.", "id": 288}]
