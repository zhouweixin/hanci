[{"review": "ino...u wana buy one of those 9.99 cheap pedals from ebay n the likes right?...NOPE!...cause when yeh doits gonna flak out after about the 10th push you do on it!!! Listen to the Voice of Experience grrr....hahahthese pedals are frikn TANKS heavy duty all the way and have a polarity switch [and yeh there's alota keyboards out thereu gota have that perc...It's worth it...just suck it up n get the thing and if you still need a momentary dsp switch then buy the lil 9.99 jobbut only use it in life or death situations..hahah [they have a really cheap plastic switch thats destined to die no matter what..at least the previous 2 i bought did...*ouch...* so is that like 20 hail mary's for that confession????.......", "id": 251}, {"review": "its cheap//it worx// what more to say?welp...only other thing to say is ashame that itdoesnt have like a thin brass slip washer with oneof those finned lock washers on the adjustment wingnutsand it'd be perfect!!!

I can buy stuff 10 times better quality from Chinaand never have this kinda junk. Maybe it's a fluke because everyone else gave it a thumbs up and I 'm really not the type a guy to go running stuff down butmaaan Ive never got a harp this trashy B4!...... all i can say is buy Merana's for tryin out buy \"suzuki\" or Swan\" from ebay/overseas if yer a poor guy like meand you'll be better off. Oh btw hot-tip for poor guys again--- you can get a \"Mississipi River Harp\" for only  $5.oo if you have a \"Burke's\" outlet near you!they're up by the counter and as good as the high dollar one made by unowho---- the Doctah has spoken! :)", "id": 826}, {"review": "First let me say im using this for a BASS (at least for this review) and nothing else. That said I LOVEBehringer products that I own. This guy was really cheap and actually the \"chorus\" part is weak...as comparedwith other chorus' I have such as (ART,ZOOM,PEAVEY,LINE-6,Gibson) Or we could say in a more positive phrase\"very subtle\" . The \"stereo\" effect for me was non-existant BUT realize I bought this item over buying a normalABY switch. Doing so saved me a bundle but in the long run I will pay for it. There is a high cycle hum in the background(which almost ALL chorus units end up having). But I can say it did the job as far as splitting a signal into 2 amplifierheads and doesnt seem to have a problem with the signal being delivered. *note* if you plan on using a 9volt dc adapteryou have laying around in yer gear/scrap bucket think again----wont work ...I tried 4 different 9volt dc adapters to no avail.all that said I still gota give the item its due.Negatives: the unit is made out of plastic and you will have to take it easy when engaging on/off. I had to take mine apart becausethe \"chorus\" wouldnt trigger \"on\" . It was due to the fact it just has a small strip of rubber that is supposed to engage with the buttonswitch on the electronics board . you may have to put something behind it or replace it.", "id": 487}, {"review": "i only bought with the idea that a \"FULL\" version of behringer's sequence program came with it....needless to says its a \"compact version\" and for you OTHER iMac/OS X Users out there????----aint worth yer timeyer better off spending your money on Vst's Au's that will WORK with OSX and Cubase or garageband....other than that its another interface \"i guess\" as long as you want to use RCA plugs to do that with...who the !$%^ uses RCA to interface there analog instruments to their puter????based on the software hustle im sorta sour but if yer a PC/Windows owner I would GET IT!!!!its about the cheapest way to \"intro\" yer way in to DAW/DAT interface.....
