[{"review": "This polish was recommended in one of Dan Erlewine's books and it works great.  It really makes the natural high gloss finish on acoustic guitars pop.  The effect isn't as noticeable on darker finishes though.  It really helps on the back of the neck too, makes it slippery and fast.  Highly recommended.", "id": 55}, {"review": "Great all round pick, one of my favorites.  Easy to grip and are pretty quite.  They wear out extremely fast though.", "id": 83}, {"review": "I'm not a string nazi and will play pretty much any major brand of strings with few exceptions.  D'Addarios are good quality and combined with Amazon Prime a no brainer bargain, under $3 per set delivered.  Unless you just don't like D'Addario I would recommend these strings highly.", "id": 156}, {"review": "I was hoping this product would eliminate string \"talking\" and had mixed results.  It helped some but didn't get rid of the noise entirely.  It also makes the strings feel nice as well.  I will continue to use it.", "id": 173}, {"review": "It does exactly what it says it does.  My only complaint is I wish it could go a notch or two lower.  But very pleased.  It's cheap and works like a champ", "id": 321}, {"review": "I love these picks.  They last a long, long time and are surprisingly easy to grip.  Currently my go to picks", "id": 626}, {"review": "Classic TubeScreamer tone at 1/4 the price..what's not to love? One of my most used pedals, great for over driving a clean tone amp.  I'd definitely buy it again.  Construction isn't great but at $40 who cares", "id": 728}, {"review": "I've bought several pairs of these for my guitars and no complaints yet.  They all work flawlessly.  I'll definitely buy more and highly recommend them.  Just like Schaller but Fender branded and cheaper (Asian made).", "id": 607}]
