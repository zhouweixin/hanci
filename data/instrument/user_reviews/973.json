[{"review": "30 feet of cable for what I paid for a 10 footer from my local guitar shop.I highly recommend!", "id": 32}, {"review": "I bought this because someone told me they really liked it...but it's just not a good product...for me anyways.I bought this to help disperse some of the weight of my Les Paul on my shoulder.  The problem is, the thick part of this strap is made too short so if I bring the neck of the guitar up to my shoulder at all, the weight of the guitar is now on the skinny part of the strap.The leather feels a bit cheap as well...you get what you pay for.I guess the strap is ok if you play with the guitar in one position...yippeee!I'll probably have to break-down and pay $100 for a real strap.", "id": 480}, {"review": "I use D'addario strings almost exclusively, they make a quality product and at $3 a box shipped to my door when I buy 10 packs is a great deal.", "id": 156}, {"review": "The sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously isn't going to last long.  Also, trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killing.I'm going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it.", "id": 317}, {"review": "Very cool little product for those of us who cannot tune by ear yet and don't want to wander around looking for our tuner that we can never find.", "id": 785}]
