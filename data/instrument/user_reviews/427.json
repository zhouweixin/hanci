[{"review": "After getting tired of spending a half hour each time changing strings, I finally caved and bought this nifty little gadget. I just wanted a string winder at first but thought this one was kinda cool and reasonably priced too. I didn't expect the string cutter to be as well as it is. I thought my wire cutters would be much better but the cutter on this baby is just as great! It also has a pin puller which I haven't tried yet but I'm sure it's great as well. This would be perfect for the gigging or traveling musician, or if you just want a great all in one tool. But this thing!", "id": 94}, {"review": "I decided to give these a try after buying just earnie balls. Wow! Just wow! My inexperienced ear was able to tell a difference in the sound. It was just... Right. I can't explain it exactly. The .10 gauge is great for standard and eb tuning, although can be tuned lower. I would recommend something thicker for that though. But these are great and you should get em!", "id": 156}, {"review": "I got this little guy for my spider IV 15 for all the awesome features and it works flawlessly. Channel switching is a breeze, with almost no delay. The tuner works great as well, I tuned it on there then with my korg tuner and it matches up. The wah volume pedal is very useful too, vol is good for fade ins or fade outs. The amount of force needed to switch to wah is quite a bit, and seems like its a little too much force that's needed, but it works. And once you're switched over to the wah, don't expect to match up with Voodo Chile or Bulls On Parade. Its good, but doesn't really cut it if you want a great wah sound. Overall though it's a good buy for your line 6 amp.", "id": 621}, {"review": "I got this strap just to try something different than a nylon. At first it was kind of weird since the strap grips your shirt a little bit and wrinkles it up if you try to move it around. But after a while I found it a quite useful feature of this strap because your guitar wont slide around when you're playing and will stay nice and steady while playing. Those with neck heavy guitars might also want to give this a shot since it grips so well. It is also very long, longer than i thought. I have it slung a little low, and there's plenty of slack left on the strap. So it's probably long enough for Shaq to use it and still sling it as low as James Hetfield.  The only complaint I have about this guitar is the fact that it was a little tough to get on my epiphone les paul. But again it adds another feature to the strap, since the thing isn't falling off anytime soon! I almost feel like I wont even need strap locks it's so good. Also the holes are very strong and have not torn open at all, which usually happens on a heavy guitar like the one I have.  All in all a perfect buy for the money.", "id": 658}, {"review": "These things are so great! I get sweaty hands when playing so the slick celluloid picks were wanting to slide in and I'd have to keep dryin off my fingers and adjusting the pick. With these I can play anything without having to worry about the pick goin anywhere. The .88 thickness is also ideal for just about any sort of music since you can chug some heavy riffs and go up and shred without any hiccups. Very nice. One thing yo note is they like to cling to each other, so if youre using one of those little pick holders when you pull one out they all want to come with it. but not that big a deal. Definitely recommend these if you're sick of picks slipping out of your hands!", "id": 680}]
