[{"review": "Real nice Guitar Picks. It came in a 6 piece pack, they deserve the Dunlop brandname because these things last a long time.", "id": 67}, {"review": "Before bying this product, I doubted a little whether or not this gadget wouldd cut the metale strings. I received it and the first thing I did is try it. IT CUTS THE MEDAL STRINGS LIKE BUTTER. I used to use whatever I could find around the house which was a pain because nothing I tried could cut these metal strings. The winder I'm not going to use, but perhaps people with tired fingers would want to use it.", "id": 94}, {"review": "Genius concept. It works for me perfectly. I no longer lose or misplace my picks. Easy to to snap the pick out of it and place it back in. It'll depend on  where you decide to place this Pickholder, I placed mine right above the jack plug", "id": 167}, {"review": "Look at the price, because this thing really sounds good. It's no toy, it's a real Retro Electric Guitar Effects Pedal. I'm very happy with  this purchase", "id": 280}, {"review": "EXCELLENT Guitar Stand. I use it to cradle my Electric Guitar, it works beautifully. Easy to to find my guitar when I want it and easy to rest it when I'm done. All you have to do is find a less traveled corner and the problem is solved. Before this Stand I used to have to hang the E-Guitar which is a risk because Electric guitars are heavy, and a pain in the neck because I had to lift and aim to hang which way too much effort after one is done playing for 2 or 3 hours.", "id": 625}, {"review": "Believe this 5 feet Cable is no small thing. The Jacks are high quality construction. Very very durable. The cable itself is thinker that ordinary guitar cable. I plan on enjoying this Cable for many many years. I'm glad I bought it, and thanks to Amazon who made it available.", "id": 419}, {"review": "I give this product a 5 stars in terms of the idea, but a 4 or less in terms of the materials used to make it, especial the outer plastic shell. The cloth in the sandwitch which does the cleaning is a good and fare material. All and all for the price it's a 5 star. Good idea to clean the strings (especial metal strings) without damaging them or the guitar itself.", "id": 543}, {"review": "This tabletop Mic Stand works. Well designed and made from descent enough materials. I would buy again when I'm ready to replace the one I have or add to it.", "id": 708}]
