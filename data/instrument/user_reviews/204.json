[{"review": "high quality hassle free design.  Very quick and easy to install and remove in a hurry and dosn't mar the finish or use excessive force,  but strong enough to move the capo all the way close to the next fret closer to the headstock to allow maximum room for my fingers without any buzzing.  Very happy with this purchase.", "id": 25}, {"review": "Does what it says!  I live the rounded edges and more streamlined apperance,  it dosnt jump out and scream look what someone stuck to this fine guiitar,  like some of the brightly colored plastic ones on the market seem to do,  this is obviously higher quality.  Well made,  a nice spring inside its practically invisible but there to slip out a pick on the fly whenever you need one!", "id": 167}, {"review": "I was considering a $100  K&K pickup to amplify a $40 pawn shop guitar I have grown fond of,  I bought it to take to the beach and camping, places where I would be too nervouse to bring my expensive guitar.  I couldnt justify spending over double for a pickup than I did for the guitar so I bought this and am glad I did.  Arrived in one day, and I first experimented with different placements using the double sided adhesive  that came with it on the outside of the guitar, plugged my cord into it un-installed and played around for 20 minutes,  you'll notice a huge difference in sound from inch to inch.  Found a sweet spot near area &#34;2&#34; on the weak instructions.  I drilled my hole using a straigh bit because my end pin was screwed into a mahoghany block almost 1&#34; thick,  I didnt want a tapered hole from a reamer,  I wated a straight hole.  As others have noted,  it was impossible to fit my arm through the soundhole, so I inserted a philips screwdriver through the end pin hole,  and slid the jack onto the tip of the screwdriver to help guide it out through the hole after first slipping on the plain washer and then the friction washer with the little teeth to dig into the wood and hold.  Because you cant reach in there and hold the jack steady while tightening the outer nuts,  they give you holes through the threaded jack (very easy to go un-noticed)  I was able to spin the washer and nut on the threaded end,  and secure them by holding the threaded portion from spinning with an ice pick or awlinsde the jack through one of the small holes while I tightened the nut firmly.  Took 3 trys before I had it adjusted to the perfect length so that when I spun the nice little finishing cap on over the threads,  it tightened down just right with the threaded portion flush with the cap for a neat appearance.  Too much and it sticks out,  too little and theres not enough thread to tighten this cap on,  you adjust the length of the installed jack with the nut on the inside of the guitar,  theres plenty of threaded jack there to accomodate any thickness of the block of wood at the tail of the guitar where the 2 sides meet.  Plugged into my fender acoustasonic 30 and Wow was blown away by the sweet sound, I am so glad I saved a ton of money!  Ordered 2 more for my other guitars,  Even one for my nylon stringed acoustic since the pickup is not magnetic.  I will say this the output is very low, nessesitating that I turn up my amp to almost 10 to fill my livingroom,  this would not work for playing out without a preamp,  but I like that theres no battery,  and I plan to buy a strap mounted external preamp that I can economize and use one preamp for my 4 guitars rather then installing 4 preamp equipped pickups in all my guitars at $100+ each!  Terrific bargain for the price!!!", "id": 611}, {"review": "Love the very fast tracking,  So convienient to have a cheap but amazing tuner on each of my guitars!  For $10 bux each,  why not???  The screen articulates so there is always a perfect view,  I am finding myself making much more minor adjustments to my tuning than I used to just because its right there and so convienient,  so my playing sounds better than ever before simply because I am always in perfect tune now!  Way better than digging out the tuner from the case in the closet, finding a expensive 9 volt battery, selecting a note you want to tune and  waiting for a needle to stop moving on  my crappy old tuner.  Just an amazing product,  I even clipped it onto my piano and bought a $30 set of tools online and saved $100 tuning my piano myself!!!", "id": 706}, {"review": "I automatically put these on any guitar I own as soon as I buy it, I change strings and toss those white plastic pins.  Makes any guitar look so much classier!  I swear there is a slight increase in the richness of the tone too!  Phenominal value,  tons of bang for the buck  They look SOOOO good on there...  Installed easily in 3 different guitars so far.", "id": 206}]
