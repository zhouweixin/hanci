[{"review": "This fender mini guitar stand works great.  It has cushin/ padding so my guitar is safe - it's small but stady.  All in all--Good purchase.", "id": 92}, {"review": "I use this ALL the time.  It's pretty basic but really good for a beginner.  (Not all chords are in here but the &#34;core&#34; chords are).  Worth the price-", "id": 394}, {"review": "I really like this thumb pick  The only thing I dispute is that this may be a large (for a girl) but NO WAY is it a large for a man.  I think a guy may have a problem wearing this comfortably.  So, Ladies!  This is a good purchase...not so much for a guy.", "id": 617}, {"review": "This electric guitar padded bag is exactly what I wanted.  The price was right, the guitar is secure and wont' get scratched.  The pockets are deep enough to hold whatever you need for a gig.  Very cost-effective.  Great price.", "id": 865}, {"review": "One of the best tuner's out there!!  It was shipped immediately and was in perfect working order!  Very happy with this purchase.", "id": 706}, {"review": "I love this guitar!! It has a terrific sound and it's GORGEOUS!  The gig bag, although not padded, works very well and is well made.  The pockets are very handy.  All in all...one of the best purchases I've made for the money.  VERY HAPPY!!", "id": 714}]
