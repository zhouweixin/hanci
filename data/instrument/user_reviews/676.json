[{"review": "I use this pedal all the time now even more than the DS-1 . Great chrunch for the buck From classic blues to rock its very eash to dial the sound you want in.", "id": 38}, {"review": "I have this hooked up to 4 Pedals so far and it's awesome. Real cost saver on batteries. You really cant go wrong for the price.", "id": 428}, {"review": "I play Guitar for the first time i have a head set that the drivers are not being over driving giving a distorted sound. The calrity is amazing !", "id": 458}, {"review": "If you want U2 kind of sounds then this is a good entry into this type of sound. Thing i dont like is a poping sound when you tunr the time knob. For the price and home use its a good pedal for someone on a budget.", "id": 488}, {"review": "I got these for the build in Pop Screen. However I found it can only be attached in one place. This is ok if you are using a full boom that&#8217;s facing the singer. But if you are working in a tight space and the boom stand is to the side of the singer , this presents difficulties. It fits my MXL mic and any mic up to 52mm without a problem.", "id": 584}, {"review": "I got this and it works well apart from the fact you have to really bang down on the keys, Im hoping over time they will be easier to press", "id": 629}, {"review": "This is a great little tuner for guitar. Love the fact i can tune all 6 strings at the same time", "id": 650}, {"review": "I got these recently. A local Music shop was wanting $80 per stand so couldn&#8217;t believe the price of these. Was expecting cheap and very plastic and was very pleasantly surprised. Great quality an very robust.", "id": 815}]
