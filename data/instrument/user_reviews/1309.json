Sorry,  I had rather not comment until it is used.", "id": 211}, {"review": "The tuner is perfect for me.  It fits in the guitar case, mandolin case and the dulcimer case.  Just perfect for making those play dates at the Resonance Fair.  Always spot on with the frequency.  Nice product.", "id": 298}, {"review": "Quality strings at a very affordable price.  They are made from quality materials and care is given with quality control to ensure the buyer of a good product.", "id": 338}, {"review": "Very good rosin and does exactly what is described.  A nice finish to the other rosin with specific bows.  No need to try mix rosin when a new bow with the rosin labeled on the bow will reduce the mystery of trying to figure out which bow to used in different temperatures and humidity.", "id": 636}, {"review": "The strings are slightly smaller than the J74 and deliver a great sound.  Several of my friends ask about the sound and the difference in the sound.  My reply was to purchase a set and give them a try.  Thanks Again", "id": 408}]
