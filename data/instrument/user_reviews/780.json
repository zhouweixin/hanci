Great for beginners.", "id": 63}, {"review": "This treatment, after I let it soak in for 24 hours, made my fingerboard look great and play fast. A little goes a long way!", "id": 344}, {"review": "It has a pleasant smell to it, not harsh at all. A little goes a long way.

It works on vibration or mic, so it's very versatile. It works on my acoustic, bass, electric, and my mother's voice. Haven't tried the trumpet yet... Intuitive and the back-lit screen is so easy to see!", "id": 707}, {"review": "This may have been the best money I've ever spent for a guitar accessory. I can dial the pressure to exactly what I need for any spot on the neck. It has a smooth action, no \"kerchunk\" noise. My guitar stays in tune when capo-ed. I love it!", "id": 761}]
