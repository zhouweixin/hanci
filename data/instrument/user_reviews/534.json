[{"review": "I opted to use the EH for its different tonal characteristics, but sometimes I still switch this one in. It's a good quality, great sounding tube. The JJ seems to be slightly more even in tone, and a little bit better sustain in the low mids, if that's what you prefer.", "id": 228}, {"review": "I like the tone of this one better than the stock one in my Champ and in my Kustom Kontender. Also, I like it more than the JJ, but the difference is subtle. The JJ version seems to be a bit brighter and slightly more noise (in a good way, but not what I want for me).", "id": 229}, {"review": "The strings definitely have a good tone, though I've got them on a low-end mandolin. They may be more than the mando needs. But they sound great!", "id": 408}, {"review": "The quality is good (the smell was funny when first opened ... I worry about China's lack of environmental concerns), but the sound is first class, very quiet, so with my Rde NT5 matched pair, I have a very quiet signal path.", "id": 426}, {"review": "It's a good quality case. I wouldn't check it as luggage when flying, but it's small so bring it as a carry-on. It'll protect your mando just fine.", "id": 752}, {"review": "Changing strings on a 12 string less often? Fantastic!!  And the sound is good. I didn't expect this much volume from light strings. The tone of the strings lasts about 4 months, in my experience, but that will depend on how much playing you get in.", "id": 110}, {"review": "This could be used for lightweight microphones but don't bother wasting your money if you're using a studio microphone. The base has a small circumference, so you can't stick the boom out very far at all, almost useless. There are better deals for just slightly more money. Or if you really want near studio quality, try the Samson studio boom mic stands.", "id": 279}]
