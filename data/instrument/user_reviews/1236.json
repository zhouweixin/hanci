[{"review": "I've only been playing ukulele for about 3 years, so I'm new to using a capo.  It seems to hold tight.", "id": 43}, {"review": "It's a button.  It's not fancy, it's silver, it screwed into my ukulele with no problem, and it works very well.", "id": 478}, {"review": "I bought this to go with my Epiphone ukulele, for both myself and my grandson.  It's a good starter amp to see what your inexpensive ukulele or guitar sounds like with an amp.  For the price, it's good.", "id": 605}, {"review": "It is a nice strap.  It takes care of business just fine.  I wish I could have found a more colorful style, but all I could find on line was black.  But it's a very good strap.", "id": 715}, {"review": "I've had two of these tuners, and they do a fine job as far as I can tell.  I lost one, and had to buy another one.  I also bought a much more expensive tuner, and I cannot see that it does a better job than this one.  I bought my first tuner like this one about 3 years ago, and the rubber pads kept falling off, but I have not had that problem with my new one.", "id": 763}, {"review": "The ukulele is very cool looking, it plays nice, it doesn't sound as nice as a more expensive ukulele, it comes with cheap strings, but it's a very fun ukulele.  I think it's worth a hundred dollars.", "id": 772}]
