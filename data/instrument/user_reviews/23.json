Sounds very very good and am happy about the fact that additional tones can be downloaded at their website. There are so many options, I spend hours just experimenting and trying different things. The possibilities are endless. Wonderful. I love it. Am sure you will too. ENJOY!!!", "id": 700}, {"review": "I used it to whenever I am changing guitar strings and whenever I am tuning and intonating my Fender Strat.
