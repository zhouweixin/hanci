[{"review": "They feel very nice with a soft touch finish on them. Fair priced and I love the color of the green ones. I like the .88 mm because its just the right mix of medium and hard; great for someone looking to play blues or rock. Cheap and easy to use, can't beat these picks!", "id": 61}, {"review": "This product isn't really one to review but it does what it advertises. I use this in conjugation with a one spot and a boss daisy chain coming from my TU-3 (great tuner by the way). Starting to build my pedal board so I figured better to start off with a 30 dollar power source than to go and spend like two hundred on a T-Rex fuel tank, which I'm planing on in the future. Great adapter for all of your pedals, decent quality, and only ten bucks. Can't beat it!", "id": 192}, {"review": "These have always been my favorite strings, and I've just about tried them all. Everything from elixirs, fenders, gibson, dunlop, and everything in between; I always end up coming back to ernie ball one way or another. Whether it be regular slinky or my ambitious not even slinky *they are a set of 12s* Overall great strings, never had a break on me, last long, sound pretty good too.", "id": 226}, {"review": "If your like me and have a big dreadnaught, especially one with a spruce top and a scalped X bracing, you should really get these strings. They bring out the brightness my guitar was hiding with the D'Daddarios and they are about the same price. Best of all they last extremely long, but I've broken a few strings over the past months. Overall great strings and pretty consistent.", "id": 295}, {"review": "I really enjoyed this tuner, extremely fast an accurate at tracking you. I've been surching for a decent tuner for about a few months now and I've demoed the pitchblack and the planet waves tuner, all never could track me as well as the TU-3 could! What I mean by tracking me, I'm talking about how fast it can respond to me changing the pitch. Its a great tuner, a little pricy, but worth it in the long run... I was even surprised they included a battery!", "id": 647}]
