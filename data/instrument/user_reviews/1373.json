[{"review": "These are nice strap locks, but the screw is hand tightened and strap movement seems to make it come loose. This can probably be solved by the use of a lock nut. Otherwise these are a good value with easy on & off.", "id": 513}, {"review": "I had bought an SN2 and love it but I found it had a little trouble recognizing the low E on my bass. This handles bass tuning much better. The lit display is great for tuning on stage, and because it works on vibration you don't need to worry about muting when you are tuning.I also find it very accurate. I would have given it 5 stars but the battery died after a couple of weeks. This is probably the seller and not the manufacturer.", "id": 762}, {"review": "I have purchased a few guitar hooks in the past for my studio. However, I wanted to add a few to our rehearsal space but didn't want to spend a lot. These did the trick fine. They are perfect to rest your axe for a bit without a guitar stand getting in your way. Especially for the price. Okay, they are not high end, but I didn't need high end ones.", "id": 779}, {"review": "I got a couple of these to accommodate different strap locks I have on different bass. The fact that it is wide is nice. As others have said you need to slide the padding down, but you can't beat these for the money.", "id": 188}, {"review": "My rhythm guitar player recently dropped and broke his SG because of no strap locks. I bought him a set of these. I use them because unless you standardize you need a separate strap for every set of locks. This eliminates that issue and is short money next to a guitar repair.", "id": 261}]
