If you're recording vocals this will eliminate the pops that gets recorded when you sing.", "id": 0}, {"review": "This pick holder is awesome. It just snaps on to your mic stand...add 6 picks and start rockin'! It holds the picks securely so if you're performing outdoors the wind wont blow them away.", "id": 70}, {"review": "A string winder and cutter ! This is a tool to carry in your guitar case at all times ! It even has a peg puller for people who have pegs on their acoustic guitars. Great quality product...I will buy another one for my uncle who performs weekly.", "id": 94}, {"review": "Don't get me wrong...this is a great little amp for practicing...but it eats batteries like they were candy. I think it was like 2 or three hours of playing and I had to throw in new batteries. But if playing on the street corner is your thing...this little amp has a belt clip.", "id": 303}, {"review": "I am a big fan of the movie &#34;Tenacious D and the Pick of destiny&#34; so when I saw these picks I just had to get them!", "id": 373}]
