[{"review": "This is my 2nd Hercules Stand. Great stand for managing multiple guitars. Does not fair well when stored in non cooled area. The handle gets real sticky and causes problems. I have a friend who also experienced the same problem. So keep it stored in climate controlled area and it is a great stand.", "id": 301}, {"review": "Great for linking close-quarter effect pedals. No noise and very durable. Great product for the price. I would recommend buying.", "id": 578}, {"review": "Exactly what I expected. A quality tuner for a low price. Very durable and gets the job done. Great buy!", "id": 707}, {"review": "Tis makes it a little awkward to carry. Overall though it does the trick with giving me something to store my stand and carry it from show to show.", "id": 403}, {"review": "If you can't afford the best guitar on the market -then buy the best strings. I would highly recommend for any acoustic guitar.", "id": 717}]
