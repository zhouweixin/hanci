[{"review": "GREAT strings!  Good quality and very good sound.  These seem a lot more stable than the 10-46 I had been using.", "id": 93}, {"review": "It's a guitar cable.  It works.  It appears to be well made and durable.  There is no noise or hum. It works and I like.", "id": 241}, {"review": "SUPER usb mic!  I use this when I broadcast from streetjelly.com. I set it a few feet away from my amp and this mic picks up the sound and send a super clean and clear signal. JUST make sure you have ALL your mic levels set to NOT CLIP and you will get nothing but super clear sounds from this mic.", "id": 743}, {"review": "Small... very small and sits right behind the headstock and very easy to see and READ. It is very accurate.  What else can I say except that this is a really great idea and it works!!!", "id": 785}, {"review": "I did not think that an amp this size would sound good. Boy was I surprized. This amp out does my old Roland Cube 60.  THis amp is LOUD...VERY LOUD!!!!!  And the tone is adjustable from great cleans to nice heavy dirty sound. All in all a super amp.", "id": 685}]
