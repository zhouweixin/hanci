[{"review": "I have these in three guitars after trying out some undersaddle and sound hole pickups. Some peope miss the &#34;quack&#34; ,electric guitar type sound from these other types. I do not. I also like that the bridge and saddle do not have to be modified ,nor is any battery required. I run it through a Baggs Para-acoustic preamp or my Fishman Aura.It really has to be installed by a professional repairman to be sure the sensors are located correctly.Product was delivered safely and promptly.", "id": 416}, {"review": "Just use a cloth or paper towel.", "id": 543}, {"review": "I installed one on my Larrivee D10E which created a more focused and pleasing bass response and reduced feedback when amplified. I then tried one on my Breedlove Custom Revival OM with poor results. I believe the Breedlove's inherent bass response conflicts with what the oport is supposed to accomplish. In both cases, I had to cut slots for my pickup controls which takes a little time and care  to do neatly. I think , for 20 bucks it is worth a shot, but don't expect miracles.", "id": 704}, {"review": "This capo is easy to install and move and does not seem to pull the strings thus maintaining tune. Adjustment is easy and effective. The same company makes a tuning capo which I find handy at times.", "id": 843}, {"review": "These strings last and they moderated some of the booming I get from other strings. I use the  EXP Phosphor bronze on my other dreads.", "id": 130}]
