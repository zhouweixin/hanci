[{"review": "I bought these thinking they were the normal sized BIG stubby picks, obviously they weren't. They're as sturdy as the BIG ones just a bit too small to be comfortable for me. I still think Amazon or whoever else could have been a bit clearer with the product information, but it's still not too bad.", "id": 164}, {"review": "I usually use Dunlop big stubby 2.0 picks. I used the Master Control Pick for the first time today, and I just had to order two more, because they're so amazing!! The attack is second to none!! At first the pick felt a bit strange as I'm accustomed to the thicker Dunlop, and I have to admit that initially I was a bit weary of the notably thinner Dava; but in no way has my playing been hindered, if anything it just seems to run along the strings effortlessly, and by far these are the most comfortable picks I've ever used!! What a find!!UPDATE 6/6/14:Still the best pick I've ever played. If you're worried about the metal tip of the pick breaking or weakening the strings, don't worry, they won't (at least not from what I've seen). Also, pinch harmonics are the easiest thing in the world to play with these picks!", "id": 171}, {"review": "If there are still people out there who don't believe in magic, just try this. It has truly elevated my playing a few notches. I'd probably have bought another bottle already, but this one seems to be lasting forever! I've had it a few months now, I use it pretty much a few times everyday, and it still seems full.If after using this your playing doesn't improve, then maybe you should give up guitar.", "id": 351}, {"review": "I've been playing with this a lot since I got it last week. It really is versatile as well as noiseless. I've mostly used it with the default settings.I haven't had the time to tweak it as much as I'd like but I can say that it is quite easy to get different tones from it. Really impressed with this wah!", "id": 379}, {"review": "I purchased this because even though I use mostly Boss effects, I also use a Behringer Hell-babe Wah. Some of the reviews mentioned that Boss effects fit perfectly and that there is a 'footprint' for a wah type effect. I must say thanks to those reviewers! The only issue I have is that I'm kinda slow, so it took me a while to realize that I had to unscrew a part of the actual board in order for the wah to sit comfortably. I was also a little bit apprehensive about using the supplied adapter with all of my pedals in case there was some sort of conflict, but so far it has been a perfect experience! This is such a sturdy board. I must say though, that I had no idea it would be so huge! This is a perfect addition to any serious rig. UPDATE 21/6/10: I've finally filled all the available slots with the addition of the Boss Phase Shifter. So far this board has performed superbly! Yes, there is some noise (as there always is when using overdrive/distortion pedals), but no more than is to be expected. I use a Boss Noise Suppressor (Sorry if this is beginning to look like a Boss ad) and it works perfectly!", "id": 462}, {"review": "The title pretty much says it all. This is such a simple, great tuner. The streaming light effect is extremely cool yet totally practical! Great deal.", "id": 647}, {"review": "I got this to compliment my filming of events, concerts etc. After my first test recording, when I played back the audio using the built-in speaker I really thought that I had been duped into believing this device was 'studio quality' ...Then I listened to that same test recording using headphones, and WOW!! This has got to be heard to be believed! There are so many applications for this recorder; it's ease of operation and quick start-up time make it ideal for hurried set-ups.", "id": 750}, {"review": "I bought my first set a long time ago and they were perfect! Then I re-ordered and I got what I think was an acoustic type because they were the same 2.0mm gauge but were too small for me to comfortably hold, so I just ended up with two dozen wasted picks. So just make sure you get the right one.12.5.11 Update: Okay, so I just realized that there are \"Dunlop Stubby Picks\" and then there are \"Dunlop BIG Stubby Picks\" Sorry...", "id": 66}, {"review": "This is the best Delay I have tried thus far. Extremely versatile and, as is typical with all boss pedals; absolutely sturdy! A delay is such a necessary addition to one's personal effects, and I really cannot emphasize enough just how perfectly this works in pretty much any style of music! Well worth the price!! Item was shipped in a timely manner and with secured packaging.", "id": 511}]
