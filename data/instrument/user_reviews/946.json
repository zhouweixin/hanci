[{"review": "I have several types of capos, this one seems well built.  A little bulky for 5 string banjo especially if you are fingering near it.  I really don't need to change that fast so use it very little, might use more in a performance setting but that is a ways off.", "id": 43}, {"review": "Brand name, good string, good tone, seem to last awhile but I change strings often so never really know how long a set will last.", "id": 59}, {"review": "I have bought and used about every banjo strap known to man, the Neotech is by far superior to anything else I have hooked up to my Gibson ESS.  The straps are easy to hook and unhook, I have two sets on my banjo, one set for the Neo and another for the harness I use when the back needs a rest.  It's easy to uphook one and hook the other.  Well done and I like the bounce feature, softens out the jolts.", "id": 101}, {"review": "Pricey as far as strings go.  A lot of people swear by them but I get just as much tone and life out of strings that cost a whole lot less.", "id": 106}, {"review": "Seems like a good and sturdy stand for the money, my banjo likes it.  It was shipped quickly and in good shape, thanks!", "id": 519}, {"review": "Have not used the strings yet, I bought them as back up.  Have used this type of string before with satisfactory results, good tone, last a long time.", "id": 225}, {"review": "Don't know what the delay was but it took forever to get here.  The picks look like they will work although they are a little hard to bend, we will see if it's what I was looking for, thanks!", "id": 404}]
