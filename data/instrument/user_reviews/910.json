[{"review": "Tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my S.G. It worked out perfectly . I am 66 years old and have been playing Guitar for over fifty years. Of course over the years I've tried other strings but always seem to come back to  Ernie Ball strings . There are no surprises. The quality Is always the same. Also, I believe the very best value for the dollar. From extra slinky to heavy gauge Jazz strings , You just can't go wrong. I am a fairly new Amazon customer and am finding out that that all important trust factor is there and have no hesitation on my part in shopping with them.", "id": 97}, {"review": "I wanted to add a chorus to my effects chain and since I have mostly Behringer products (and am more than satisfied with my other pedals) decided to try the CO400. Again I am more than satisfied. A chorus isn't something you use all the time so I expect this one to give me years of good Behringer reliability and service. For someone looking for that extra color in your sound  try this pedal.I think you'll be pleasantly surprised and you sure can't beat the price. A great value for your money.", "id": 431}, {"review": "I borrowed a friends MXR to try and liked the added sounds it gave me. It filled a hole that was missing . since 80% of my board is Behringer pedals I looked at Behringer first and was delighted when I found the PH9 Classic 90 . Side by side with the MXR , there wasn't a hole lot of difference and with the Behringer's added swirl switch , gives you a few more options. It also is made of metal for all of you that constantly criticize Behringer for their use of plastic in there other pedals. ( I've read a ton of reviews and still haven't heard of one breaking because of the plastic ) As far as value to money spent , This pedal is again at the top of the list. Oh! It also sounds great!!!!!", "id": 498}, {"review": "I replaced my delay foot pedal with the Behringer VD400 Analog Delay. For the money it is a more than a competent addition to my pedal board . It is doing exactly what I expected and much more. The big name delay I replaced , in all honesty , wasn't as good. I have more room and control with this pedal. Also I can buy six of these pedals for what I paid for the last one ... You do the math!!!!", "id": 506}, {"review": "I gave this product 5 stars , simply because it did exactly what I bought it to do - reduce unwanted noise to my amp. You will have to play with the controls to get the exact settings where its not clipping your sustained notes off before you want it to. It doesn't cut noise while your playing , but when your not it comes on a kills the noise. There are two lights on the pedal, one for the on and off and the other comes on when the pedal is working and reducing noise. If you have it set to high or to sensitive , it will not recognize the end of your sustained note and noise . So play with it and find your personal setting because I'm sure every guitar and pedal board are unique in the sounds that start with your guitar and go through your pedal chain and out your amp. The NR300 works and as soon as you understand how it will do the best job for you , you will be happy with it. Oh, and if you switch it to Mute, it works as an on and off switch.. You also can not beat the price----", "id": 615}, {"review": "The product was exactly what was advertised and completely filled the Job it was intended for. service was more than expected", "id": 735}, {"review": "I needed some new patch cables for my board and I liked the different color thing. I believe this was part of my first order through Amazon and was totally satisfied with the process and the result . Will and have used it since. Thank you.", "id": 805}]
