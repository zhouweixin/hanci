[{"review": "I just put it on my Baby Taylor guitar strap.  Nice!  Does the job and does it well.  Comes in a \"guitar shaped\" package that clearly shows how to install it in seconds if you are a newbie.  Glad I got this one.  It is exactly what I was hoping it would be.", "id": 174}, {"review": "The price was right so I got one.  Does the trick for the beginner or for sheets of music.  Books don't do so well and prove to be top heavy most of the time, even some smaller ones.  Strictly for practice.", "id": 257}, {"review": "If you are getting this amp only for portable practice and just want to hear what you are playing and do not care if it sounds great then you will be happy with this little amp.  It sounds surprisingly good for twenty bucks. I said good, not loud.  Loud enough, yes. I suggest buying a power brick so you can plug it in for daily home use because the batteries only last for about five hours of playing time.  This is a great little amp for camping, a quick lesson, or going to a friends house for a little jamming etc.. If you keep your expectations reasonable you will be pleased.  Great color and retro style as well.", "id": 302}, {"review": "This is, for the price I paid for it here on Amazon (far less than what it is currently selling for) a very good buy.  At the current price of almost 30 bucks, I would pass or look at other options but that is just me.  The leather is attractive, thick enough, soft enough for the price, and I found the length to be more than long enough for me personally.  I almost have it on the shortest possible setting and there is far more room to let out.  Only really tall people, big people, or \"low players\" will be disappointed perhaps.  I only have a few very MINOR complaints and of course my complaints are subjective so YMMV.  One, the back side of the strap is not black.  It's a blue/grey color and I didn't realize that.  You can see a tiny bit of the greyish color in the photo but not enough to really get an idea of what the backside looks like.  I assumed incorrectly that both sides were black.  Two, the embossed design is a little feminine for my tastes.  All that said, it is nice and some will love it.  Quality at the right price.  Easy to adjust.  Looks like it will last.  Solid four stars despite me personal opinion.", "id": 660}, {"review": "At the time of me writing this review, these little guys are hard to find and keep selling out quickly.  I was lucky enough to get my hands on one early.  I almost purchased the very nice Ditto Looper when I started looking for a small and simple looper pedal.  The Ditto is great and should be considered if you are in the market for a tiny looper pedal that does nothing but loop well and at an affordable price.  That said, the Digitech Express XT is a little better.  Both work well but the Digitech has a few more features in almost as small of a foot print.  Here are those features.  The Digitech takes batteries or a power adapter, is cheaper than the Ditto, has 5 more minutes of looping memory, can be daisy chained to other Digitech loopers for multi-tracking and they synch, has LED lights so you know where you are, and it has stereo in/out.  None of these are deal breakers alone but together and currently for 30 bucks less, the Digitech Express XT is the clear winner IMHO if you can find one to buy.", "id": 891}, {"review": "Nice little device.  We'll see how long it lasts (a cheap little plastic thing really) but so far it does the job and holds about 6 or so medium picks easily without issue.  I use it with the medium dunlop picks.  Glad I got it.", "id": 167}, {"review": "It works.  It is cheap.  It does the job well.  A review mentioned it didn't come with batteries.  Mine came with batteries. I highly recommend it as do all of the other reviews.", "id": 707}, {"review": "I will keep my review short as there have been MANY factual and well written reviews for the various Snark tuners over the years.  Quickly though, I will start by also agreeing that for the price, it is hard to beat.  This is mostly why I have given it 4 stars and just bought a sixth one.  It is accurate, reliable for tuning, and affordable.  All that said, here is why I decided to write a review.  I have owned about 5 of these Snarks and every single one has broken after about 3-4 months use.  The unit itself is great.  Here is the problem.  Where the tuner attaches to the guitar and where the tuner attaches itself to it's own clip is where this little gem falls short.  Sure, if you put it on a guitar and leave it there at home, it will likely last at least a year and maybe longer requiring a battery change one day if you are lucky.  However, if you travel with it, take it on or off a few guitars a day, or frequently adjust it, it will likely eventually break.  Either the \"rubber feet\" that come into contact with the head stock of the guitar will come off and get lost or the little ball joint that connects the tuner's head to the clip part will break.  Best to get several of these at this great price and just keep one on each of your guitars.  One for the electric, one for the acoustic, etc.  This item does not travel well and is best used at home gently.", "id": 811}]
