[{"review": "This is my guitar pick of choice.  I  fits well in my hand and is well balanced.  Have tons of picks , but seem to use this one all the time.", "id": 117}, {"review": "Does it all.  Perfect for cleaning and waxing guitar; don't need a bunch of different items; this does it all.", "id": 348}, {"review": "I have had plenty of these.  Lots just snap apart in the back, or don't even work properly when you try and tune them.  This one is spectacular.  It is real accurate, snaps on to the headstock perfectly.  Best I've ever found so far in a tuner.", "id": 785}, {"review": "I have had 2 of these tuners (you'd think I'd learn after one).  They calibrate okay , it's just that they tend to break where the swivel ball fits into the socket of the device (both of mine broke this way).  To me, for the price, it's made cheaply.  Try D'Addario instead; love their tuners.", "id": 811}, {"review": "I love this product.  I t holds your guitar very securely and does lease the guitar at the neck extremely fast, so y don't have to life it over your head.  Well worth the price.", "id": 174}]
