[{"review": "the best thing I've purchase for my guitars this year , I'm not that careful with my guitars maintenance and never though that my fretboard and body finish need that care until i see a video that explain why is important and the live that obviously the instrument get back after cleaning , the 01 and 02 are the best, restore the live of my fretboard, the cleaner and polish make your instrument body shine , the only one that I've just use once is the string conditioner and cannot say because i use this on my brother acoustic guitar and i don't play with it after the cleaning ,but my guitars strings are new right now maybe i update in a few weeks about the strings conditioner.you can buy this with your eyes close, you wont regret the purchase.", "id": 95}, {"review": "this is a must have pedal for any rock player, tight compressed distortion sound , you could play with the EQ to get the sound your looking for, it goes from an overdrive sound to a really heavy distortion, It's build to last forever, the sustain is fantastic and the top boost give you another range of possibility's.the only downside is the battery, get the power adapter , batteries wont last more than 2 or 3 days and you have to unscrew the back to replace it.Overall, I'm really happy with this pedal.", "id": 399}, {"review": "After reading a bunch of reviews about this product, i was not sure about buying it , but i give it a try and i am completely satisfy, it doesn't ad noise to my pedal chain, i use it with a radioshack power supply 9v 2.5 A , and a can tell that not a sound came from electric issues.I'm not saying that it is better than a voodoo lab power brick , but for me work perfect and i don't see why not taking it out for Gigs.", "id": 486}, {"review": "I purchase this because my older springs wont return to it original place leaving my guitar tuning a half step up or down when using the whammy bar, This fender springs work excellent and fit perfectly on my Jackson dk2 ,  I'm using 3 springs right know and stay's in tune no matter the abuse.the only Con on this product is that they are noisy, is not that you will hear it in a rehearsal with a band or a concert but you definitely will hear them when you are alone practicing.", "id": 676}, {"review": "This is the second one i buy and i love it, is small, fast and accurate , best of all, you don't need to have the volume knob open for tuning, i bough this one as a birthday present for a friend and i know is inexpensive, but it feel quality and does it job perfectly , my friend love it above all the other gift, it is a everyday use tool for a musician.", "id": 707}, {"review": "Well , at first i was looking for a reverb with a long and deep sound, like a grail or church, then i read about this tone print thing and i really like it, this give you a totally new range of sound based on a specific artist preset, so you can have a bunch of tone prints that you can download from the webpage, the only thing  that could be better is the instructions on how to download the tone prints it doesn't came with the instructions, although is really easy but at first i was blindfolded, but overall it is great.", "id": 748}]
