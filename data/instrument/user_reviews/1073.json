I like them a lot and they last forever (almost :)these were a little thick for my tastes. The red ones are a little thinner and give better action for strumming and also for fast alternate picking patterns.If you like a medium thick pick though, these are rockin.", "id": 61}, {"review": "It's sturdy, and very portable. The two things I was looking for.Can't really compare to the others, but for me worth the price. I didn't have one at all and this workgs great.delivered in a timely manner.thanks!", "id": 258}, {"review": "I love this tuner... I have other similar models, and they are all great.don't hesitate to get one.These are three times as high at guitar center.  how ridiculous.ok.. this may sound silly, but just to let you know you can do it.if you hold a stick or something similar touching your throat, and clip this tuner to it, you can tune your voice with it.even holding your thumb against your voicebox and clip this on your finger will do it.cracks me up, but fun to play with", "id": 762}, {"review": "These snark tuners are really cool.This SN-8 model comes this a metronome, and also you can scale up/down with buttons for when using a capo.highly recommended.", "id": 820}]
