The pick pocket is cool, though I won't be using it.", "id": 285}, {"review": "Believe it or not, I've yet to use this screen. I was short a shock mount for one of my Cad condensers. I've yet to use that mic again. Go figure. But I love the way screen and mount look? I know. So esoteric. But I'm still giving it 5 stars.

These capo, I know, will lose their tension in time. I thought I had chosen a different capo.
