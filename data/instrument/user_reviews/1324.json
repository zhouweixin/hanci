[{"review": "I bought this for my M-Audio keyboard but it also works equally well with my Casio Lighted Keyboard.Just be sure that your keyboard has a sustain pedal connection.This is a very heavy duty unit that feels and operates exactly like the sustain peddle on a piano.", "id": 251}, {"review": "Unfortunately, these tuners require drilling to fit my Squier Strat.They look very similar but the two pins are approximately 1/16th of an inch further out from the shaft so I'm going to have to drill new holes in the headstock to use them. Worse, the holes will actually touch the edge of the existing stock holes so, I'm going to have to fill them, first.The quality of the locking tuners looks great!I only wish that they'd show a diagram with the specs written on it so that I could have known that these don't fit my guitar!", "id": 387}, {"review": "A little patients sanding the saddle to fit my 1973 vintage Guild (better fit than the plastic original that it replaced!) and the sound expanded beyond my expectations! I also replaced the bridge pins with Tusq made ones and the nut was already made from bone.", "id": 415}, {"review": "I needed this balanced cable to connect a clip-on mic pickup for my acoustic guitar.It works perfectly and my recording are rich and full.Great price, too!", "id": 602}, {"review": "I first installed one of these in a new 'laminated' guitar, to test it and I was truly blown away by the quality of the sound! I had purchased this guitar for practicing during our cold and dry, New England winter!The sound was so good that I ended up putting another one into my prized, 1973 Guild Madeira (built in Japan!). This guitar sounds much better than the laminated Fender does and this pickup reproduces it accurately through my Fender amplifier's 'clean' setting.I tried attaching the pickups in various positions but found that I liked the sound the best when the pickup was attached slightly below, towards the bottom of the guitar and slightly favoring the treble strings side of the bridge, just off center in the lower X-bracing.YouTube has several good installation videos that show you exactly how-to install an acoustic pickup such as this one.I've used these pickups now to record several of my favorite guitar pieces. It's wonderful, no longer having to keep the guitar perfectly still with relations to an external, stand mounted microphone!If you wish to record your acoustic guitar, this is an effective and very inexpensive solution for that!", "id": 611}, {"review": "What's not to love about these strings? The sound is fantastic ... they ring like they should. But my fret hand no longer gets tired after playing all night long.", "id": 613}, {"review": "I bought this to run from my peddle board to my guitar.Since the peddle board is right in front of me, the coiled nature of the cord keeps me from getting tangled up.What surprised me was how it improved the sound? I hadn't thought that a cable would do this but I've since been told that I'm not the only player that has noticed this phenomena. It's beyond me how this works but I can hear the difference so, I'm changing over to all coiled cords.", "id": 709}, {"review": "Brilliant solution to the strap button problem! The pointy end makes it quick and easy to get your strap over the button while the larger sized top will then hold the strap on so it won't slip off! Works as well as locking strap buttons did, for me.", "id": 786}, {"review": "I've just replaced the original, plastic nut on my new Squier Strat guitar with this one.I had to file it down slightly to fit the slot and set the string height that I wanted but this was simple to do using a single flat metal nail file.I was shocked at how much 'brighter' the guitar sounded with only this single change!Even my wife who claims to have a tin ear, commented on how much clearer it now sounds.Also, the shipping time warning was a bit over exaggerated. My piece arrived in a week (thank you very much!).For the low price, I think this will improve the sound of your guitar (safely) more than any other upgrade.", "id": 857}, {"review": "These are slightly larger diameter than the original pins were. This is exactly what I wanted since my 1973 acoustic guitar has been restrung so many times that the bridge pin holes were getting loose enough that the original plastic pins were very low and difficult to grab and pull out. These new pins fit those holes perfectly and make stringing my guitar a pleasure, again! And there is also a noticeable improvement in the sound, over that produced by the plastic pins.", "id": 263}]
