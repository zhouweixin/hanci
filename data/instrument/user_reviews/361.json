[{"review": "I am deployed to middle east and beat my guitars up pretty good.  I have 3 World Tour bags to keep my axes safe!  Nice padding, nice features.", "id": 311}, {"review": "I love pedal trains because they are lightweight, come with a case and are easy to work with.  If pedaltrain asked me my opinion I would say that they needed to raise the back up about 1-2&#34; to allow for power brinc underneath and to aid in angle of use, but other than that, its a pedaltrain...nuff said!", "id": 588}, {"review": "No way this thing cost lest than $40.  I needed a small pedal board and didnt want to put a lot of money into pedals so I gave the Joyo pedals a try and I am pleasently surprised.  This compares very closely to my high end OD pedals I own...in a metal case???? BONUS.  I'm super happy with my Joyo pedals.", "id": 795}, {"review": "No way this thing cost lest than $40.

I needed 220V power overseas and so I ordered this.  It is truly a very nice product and amazingly quiet.  I currently have some high end power bricks on my two larger pedal boards...I may swamp them out fo this one.  Highly Recommend it.", "id": 428}]
