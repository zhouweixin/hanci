[{"review": "This mike is a great way to start recording at home. I use it with a small behringer mixer and garageband on my mac and just having a ball. I know its not the nice wiz bang high dollar type and maybe their are others just as good for the price. However, I find the mic being real step up from using dynamic mikes for recording at home.", "id": 254}, {"review": "Other than being a little cheaply built it works great. I like the fold up into a small package idea. Room for a stand in the vehicle can be a problem for most of these types of stands. I can put this over the shoulder, carry my guitar and gigbag in one trip.", "id": 357}, {"review": "They are not designed with a switch to have all lights on at the same time. So if you need that sort of control on your lights this will not do it. They are fairly bright and the lightweight metal body is nice.", "id": 534}, {"review": "The Taylor strap is very nice and works like a strap should. You will notice that it does not slip around once over the shoulder like the nylon cheap straps do.", "id": 612}, {"review": "I gig a lot and since I am a grey haired musician I need to sit when it will be over an hour of playing. This seat works great for me and folds up and can be disassembled with very little fuss. The back rest support is nice, too. For the price its well constructed and perfect for the solo musician doing gigs all over the country.", "id": 518}, {"review": "I use to have a guitar that sounded horrible with this thing in there. It was a pain to take out, too. However, it got a new lease on life with my new guild guitar. It did stop feedback issues and sounded somewhat better overall. I had to cut part of it for the volume and tone control which is located in the sound hole. Something you might want to think about before getting one of these.", "id": 704}]
