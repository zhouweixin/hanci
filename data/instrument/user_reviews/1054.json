[{"review": "I purchased this key on a whim.  When it arrived the instructions were not clear, but I sat the dial to #2, loosened all of the lugs on my floor tom and went around my lugs using opposing lug patterns, and tested the first cut of tuning. Too loose and deep, so I increased the setting to #3 and repeated.  Almost the sound I wanted, so I used a regular key and went an eighth turn using the same pattern.  Perfect.  I then started on the next largest tom, working back to the smallest.  Using the #3 setting plus an eighth turn I got my toms 1/2 octave apart.Next I worked on my snare drum, starting with the snare side, then the batter side. I used #4 on the batter side and #5 on the snare side, and managed to get the crisp, yet warm, sound I wanted. The bass drum came next - I set the batter side tension 1 notch below the resonant side and achieve a great tuning. From there I went back and set the resonant sides of each of my four toms one notch higher than the batter side and marveled at the perfect tuning I attained.This is an easy device to use - with the lever facing you move it to the left, loosen all of your lugs, then tighten each starting with one or two. When the lever clicks and moves to the right position you have reached the torque setting.  Test, increase a notch if necessary, and repeat until you get the sound you want. Set the resonant heads either one notch higher or lower to make sure the batter and resonant heads do not cancel each other (and to your desired sound), and you will have a perfectly tuned set.I'll never go back to tuning by ear!  You'll be amazed by the results if you tune with this key, and don't forget to write down your optimum settings.", "id": 112}, {"review": "This is an ingenious clutch that engages when you step on your hi-hat pedal, but will drop to the closed position when you hit the lever on the top. This allows you to either ride closed hi-hats when using both bass pedals, yet return to normal hi-hat playing when the music calls for it.Be aware that this clutch has only two positions - open and fully closed. However, there is a way to work around this if you like partially open hi-hats in the closed position for a sizzle sound.  I did a work around by placing a spring on the hi-hat stem, with metal and felt washers on the top of the spring, which gives me that opening when I drop the cymbal to closed.  There was a lot of trial and error finding the right spring because each cymbal pair has a different height when mated together, and I was looking for a tiny fraction of an inch opening.  Too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound. Too large or stiff and you will not get the sound.  However, this is all personal preference, and many drummers ride a fully closed hi-hat anyway, which makes this clutch perfect out of the box.Regardless of your hi-hat style, if you are using a double bass, this is a \"must have\" accessory. Gibraltar's model is solid, heavy duty, and engages and disengages perfectly every time.", "id": 150}, {"review": "*Incredible quality and value.These cables are high quality in every respect and are much better than I expected for the price.They use heavy duty wire and insulation, and are well constructed. They employ quality connectors, and have strain reliefs on each end.The dual velcro ties are another indication of the quality of these cables, and the color coding is a big plus as well.Not only is the product outstanding, but I was contacted by the seller after the purchase to make sure I was happy with the cable set.I am so pleased with this purchase that I am a customer for life.*", "id": 438}, {"review": "These heads are virtually indestructable and produce a great sound. Attack is superb, especially when played hard and loud, and the construction ensures minimal ring and overtone.Be aware that this head pack does not product the best tone and sound for jazz (get Remo Fiberskyns for that kind of sound), but the Pinstripe model that comprises this pack has become the De Facto standard for rock.If you still have the heads that come with your drum kit - and play rock - changing over to this pack will probably make a dramatic improvement in the way your kit sounds, regardless of whether you are playing a budget no-name brand, or Pearl, Mapex, Tama, Ludwig or similar pro quality drums.I also recommend that you get a Rhythm Tech Memo Key (ASIN B0002E2EOE) or Evans Torque tuning key (ASIN B0002D0HZI) to allow you to quickly get your heads in perfect tuning once you have them installed.  Either of these will allow you to get the most out of these (or any other) heads and transform your kit into a finely tuned, professional sounding set of instruments.", "id": 180}, {"review": "When I purchased this pedal from a local music store I wasn't even looking for a double pedal set, but for a replacement for the pedal that came with my Tama Stagestar kit.  During my quest for a pedal that had the feel I wanted I sat behind a Pacific drum kit that had these pedals. At first I ignored the second bass pedal and played a bit with just the right pedal and hi-hat.  I liked the feel of the right pedal and was about to ask if the store had it in a single pedal configuration when I decided to see what it was like playing double. Wow - it immediately expanded my range and opened up a plethora of possibilities.This pedal is nearly infinitely adjustable, especially cam rotation, spring tension, and beater offset.  Most of the adjustments require a hex wrench, which is fairly standard for most modern single and double pedals. The left side slave pedal has a full floorplate, and the linkage rod that connects the right and left pedals will not bind at any angle I have tried.  There is a slight lag on the left pedal, which is normal for any double pedal configuration, but you'll quickly compensate for that as you get used to a double pedal if you are moving from a single pedal.Before I purchased this particular model I tried out Tama's Iron Cobra, Pearl's Powershifter and a Gilbralter Avenger.  I did not like the stiffness of the Iron Cobra, but did like the Pearl and Gibraltar pedals.  It finally came down to either this or the Gibralter, which was slightly smoother, but significantly more expensive.  I opted for best value without sacrificing performance or quality and am thrilled with this pedal.If you are moving from a single to double pedal configuration I strongly recommend that you give this one a serious look.  More importantly, try out this pedal in a local store and compare it to other double models - selecting a bass pedal is a personal decision with many more factors than price, features and quality.  It has to feel right.  In addition, you will find that you will be using the double bass more than your hi-hat, which means that you will need to compensate.  For that I recommend the Gibraltar hi-hat drop clutch (ASIN B0002F73YY), which will allow you to engage and disengage your hi-hat with ease.  I have my hi-hats set for a slight opening in the normal closed position, but stepping on the hi-hat pedal - using the clutch - puts it in full play position.  Tapping the lever on the clutch closes them again.  This clutch is a perfect companion to a double bass pedal!", "id": 445}]
