Highly recommend for budget tuner.", "id": 331}, {"review": "If you buy the keyboard you're going to need the power adaptor. Sucks that Yamaha runs this scam of not supplying the power cord and making you buy it separate but I suppose the nickle and dimes really add up for them. Power cord fine. Yamaha shady.", "id": 476}, {"review": "For the price, this stand cant be beat. You got a mic? You need a boom stand? here you go. Does the job.", "id": 585}, {"review": "I'll be honest, the reason I got these strings is because of the cheap price. I'm a professional bass player who plays guitar for fun only. These seem fine to me. Good tone and they stay in tune.", "id": 198}, {"review": "Why didn't I think of this? Is what it is and does what it says its does. From Martin, nuff said!", "id": 568}, {"review": "Its a little stiff and I'm sure it will soften up upon more use. Cant beat the price! I used this on an acoustic bass and it is plenty long.", "id": 656}]
