[{"review": "It's a very cute little capo. It works great on my ukulele and mandolin but of course it's hard to use because when you get into the higher frets the frets are VERY small. But it works.", "id": 43}, {"review": "This stuff works amazingly. If your interested in buying the product, don't listen to the people who say it is too dry. I thought it worked good, and mine was a bit dry. This stuff isn't supposed to be really waxy, its a hard wax so I would think it was supposed to be cracked. Mine wasn't that cracked, and it worked great! I love this product and would definitely recommend it and say this is a must-have.", "id": 336}, {"review": "I bought a guitar that had been sitting in a guys closet for the longest time, and the fret board was so dry and colorless. I used this, and the color became rich and less dry. If your fret board is pretty dry, DO NOT remove the oil. Let it sit overnight and then remove it with a towel. Leave it longer depending on how dry the fret board is. I love this because it doesn't leave an oily residue and it doesn't have a smell that stands out. I didn't even notice a smell. I definitely would say this is a must-have.", "id": 344}, {"review": "Removes grime and such. Makes surfaces very smooth(I don't know how it works individually, I used it with Gerlitz cleaning spray). It works well with cleaning spray.", "id": 437}, {"review": "Please don't listen to these amateurs talking about how the strings wouldn't keep tune. They don't know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings. You have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch. Like all instruments, the strings have to stretch, especially with nylons, so be patient. It only took me about half an hour. It clearly states STARTER pack, so obviously its not going to be a high quality ukulele, especially because of the price. These people just do not know how to read. It has a great sound, but the 'lightweight gig bag' definitely is lightweight. If you want real protection, I would recommend getting a hard case or something along the lines. it is a great buy though, considering the price. I highly recommend this product.", "id": 766}, {"review": "This works amazing! It is very thick, which is great for a nicer sound on the mandolin. It also works great for a guitar. It works really nice with steel strings, but I have yet to test it on my ukuleles nylon strings.", "id": 771}]
