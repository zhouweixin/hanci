[{"review": "I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose, nearly stripped, when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset, but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough, and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day.", "id": 111}, {"review": "I dunno, cause I'm stingy with stars.  These have a nice sound.  I had an old guitar I bought for cheap at a garage sale for my son (8 at the time) to play on, but never really cared for it.  I finally got it out and started to tune it, but the steel strings broke.  SO I replaced with these.  It's a classic guitar, it shouldn't have had steel strings to begin with.", "id": 349}, {"review": "Very very useful.  Like seriously, unless you are very very good, you can QUICKLY get a sharper tuning with a snark than you can by ear.", "id": 706}, {"review": "I have about quit using picks now.  But I needed a variety pack to try different thicknesses.  That's what you get with this.  From very thin and flexible to 0.8 and hard, you get a selection.", "id": 879}, {"review": "This is a modeling amp.  IT has several presets, to emulate different sounds.  They factory settings for these are pretty good, and all but the first bank (of three) can be adjusted and saved as new presets on the amp.  If you get the fender fuse software (license comes with the amp) you can get some pretty amazing &#34;pre&#34; sets from fender and other users.This is not a massive cabinet, so you aren't going to get that &#34;big&#34; a sound, regardless. But for a small room it's great!Common complaint I have seen:  No clean channel/preset.This is not the case.  There are a couple of factory presets that are &#34;clean&#34; although some people want cleaner.  You can either adjust the gain/vol yourself or download one of several VERY nice very clean presets from the fender forums.  That said, one of my guitars is edgy, it wants to overdrive the amp.  Another doesn't, and is very clean, even on the factory preset clean.I very nearly got a different amp.  I went to a music store and a salesman showed me a Mustang II.  I was sold when he showed me what all it could do - then showed me the price for a Mustang I!!  For ~$100 USD this is about as much as you could possibly ask for.It'll keep me busy for a long time.", "id": 882}]
