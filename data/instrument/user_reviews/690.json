[{"review": "It is a string winder, what more can I say. It works as it should and saves time. Very useful when restringing a guitar.", "id": 94}, {"review": "Used this to dress up the Saga tele kit I bought on Amazon. It fit perfect and gives the Fender name to a Saga kit guitar. Don't think I'll fool anyone but what the heck.", "id": 527}, {"review": "If you play a lot you have to install these on all your guitars and straps. Easy to use and very secure. No fear of the strap coming loose and having your guitar drop to the floor.", "id": 607}, {"review": "I would give this 5 stars for the way it works but a 49 page instruction book to utilize all it potential is a bit much. Something simpler would suffice. Really just wanted to record a rhythm track and play lead over it. If you don't mind spending the time to learn all it's capabilities it's great.", "id": 668}, {"review": "Didn't want to spend $150 for a reverb so gave this a try. Nice unit. Recreates spring reverb very accurately. Playing through a 333 tube amp and it sounds like the spring amp in my Fender. For the price you can't go wrong.", "id": 699}, {"review": "Works great right out of the box. Easy to use and accurate. A must have for any guitar player. Turn it on, clip it on and tune.", "id": 706}, {"review": "Excellent stomp box. You can dial it right in to get that SRV sound. Very sturdy and very well made. A must have for any blues player.", "id": 446}]
