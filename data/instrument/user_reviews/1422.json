[{"review": "This is a really nice product for the price.  When fully extended, it becomes a little tippy, but I don't fully extend the legs which gives it a wider, more stable base.  Otherwise, it folds up nice and small for travel.  Nice product!", "id": 257}, {"review": "This is great if you have to put your guitar down but don't want to put it in its case.", "id": 258}, {"review": "There is a problem with the design.  When you move the head, the 3 little plastic pieces that hold the ball that allows you to rotate the head, just break off.  The tuner itself is great, but the product fails because it broke in 5 minutes.", "id": 706}, {"review": "I put this on my mandolin.  This does not work as well as some others I have tried, but the other one I was using broke very easily, so I looked for a different, more sturdy design.  This works OK.  Not the greatest, but OK.", "id": 785}, {"review": "You have to get this cap on JUST right or the strings will buzz.  I think I'll keep this as a backup and get a better one for my every day use.", "id": 603}]
