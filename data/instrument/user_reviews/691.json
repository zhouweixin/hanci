[{"review": "It has a comfortable seat and seems stable and well-made.  However, if you need to haul it around frequently, it takes a bit of time to set up and screw down or open up the screws that hold the moving stability bar on the bottom of the seat. Also, if you need to adjust the height, you have to remove the entire bolt assembly seen at the crossing point of the bars, and then select one of three holes that are only an inch or some apart from each other.  So, not much selection there.", "id": 306}, {"review": "This is certainly a heavy duty stand!  It weighs quite a bit, is made of solid metal, and I would not hesitate to think it could hold quite a bit of weight.  However, while it seems stable side-to-side, the spread of the legs does not taper much at all from top to bottom, and I believe it would fall over quickly if bumped from the front or back.  This makes me nervous for live performances or close quarter practices.", "id": 358}, {"review": "The mixer arrived early, which was a life-saver.  I immediately put it to use at a musical venue in which all four microphone pre-amps were used for three vocalists and one flute, and the CD input was connected to a computer that was playing a minus track for the vocalists.  Everything functioned well and the medium reverb effect performed well on all inputs.  I am looking forward to using more of the effects.", "id": 369}, {"review": "Eveyhing arrived in a timely fashion, worked perfectly out of the box, and has been used several times to record choirs and piano. The sound is clear and well-balanced and the microphone picks up sound very well within the range of around 10 feet.", "id": 644}, {"review": "I popped the included battery into place, fired it up, clipped it to the head of my electric guitar, and it worked seamlessly.  For the price, this is a great deal!", "id": 706}]
