[{"review": "This pop-filter rocks. I like it a lot, does well compared to lots of other filters I tried. It's got a nice look too.", "id": 46}, {"review": "With a nice clean, crisp sound, inexpensive price, and durable history, I've made these strings apart of my acoustic set. I've got at least 6 spares at home right now. XD", "id": 60}, {"review": "Great item!Sturdy, had it for a few weeks now. Small, light, durable. Holds the strings down perfectly too Great capo!", "id": 304}, {"review": "This is a good, durable mount. I like the look of it, as well as the light-weight feel. Not much else to be said.", "id": 393}, {"review": "At first I was skeptical of this nifty little tuner, but since I've been using it for the past few weeks, I've yet to have one complaint. It sits right atop, clipped to the guitar, operates on vibrations, so doesn't pic up other guitars, is light, barely even notice it, and seems quite accurate.", "id": 706}, {"review": "While it is just a stand, it seems to be sturdy and durable. Nothing special about it, but also no negatives that I can find either, than the fact that it doesn't give my foot massages. XD", "id": 258}]
