[{"review": "I have several guitar and ukulele chromatic tuners.  They all work fine for me.  However, the Snark SN-2 just has the edge. It's performance, look and feel are great!  The added features are also a plus.  I use the Snark for both ukulele and accoustic guitar.  It's my go to for chromatic tuner.  Highly recommend this.", "id": 707}, {"review": "Got a new tenor uke and couldn't resist putting my fav strings on it.  Replaced GHS strings.  So far, so good.", "id": 829}, {"review": "These strings are the best.  Haven't found any others that sound and feel so good.  They lasted 3 years and I play nearly every day for hours.  Go figure!  I actually thought I didn't need to change strings (still don't know for sure) because they still sounded so good and show no wear.  Anyway I decided to change the strings because it's been so long.  Happy that I did however.", "id": 830}, {"review": "DAddario's are my go to strings for my Washburn and Ibanez acoustics.  They sustain well, great tone, tune well, and last for a good while between changes.", "id": 198}, {"review": "I like the SN-2. Just thought I'd try the SN-8 Super tight tuner and was not at all disappointed.  Snark tuners have always performed well for me.  I play guitar and ukulele.  I've used and own many tuners and brands.  The Snarks just work great and the price is hard to beat.  I usually buy several at a time and give them as gifts to my musician friends.  For anyone who plays acoustic guitar - these things are so handy.", "id": 820}]
