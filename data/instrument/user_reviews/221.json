[{"review": "I used to think a pick was a pick, with the only difference being stiffness. (I should say that I prefer picks of medium stiffness). The only problems I had with \"regular\" picks was: (1) them slipping in my hand (turning around), (2) out of my hand (on the floor), and, of course, (3) breaking. I decided to give the Dava picks a try. I bought a pack of the \"jazz\" picks and a pack of these \"grip tips\". I really thought I'd like the jazz picks better: that they would be easier to grip and more like a regular pick. But, after trying them both, I find these (the grip trips) are now my \"pick of choice\". They fit my grip perfectly, stay put in my hand, and give me maximum control when I play, whether it's lead or rhythm. I have yet to break one. I'm mainly buying another set because I've given a few away for people to try and I want to have plenty readily available. I like to leave picks laying around my house at various optimum locations, so whenever I pick up a guitar to play, I've got one close by (also always keep a spare in my wallet). Bottom line is, for me at least, these picks are tops! Sure I can still use a regular pick when that's all that's available. But why not use the best when I can???Update: Been using these picks for a year since my first review. Still love them. Still have yet to break one (and I can be an aggressive strummer). The only reason I need to buy more: I lose them. I have to admit they are a bit pricey, compared to other picks. But for me, they are still tops. Which is why I'm buying another half dozen.", "id": 170}, {"review": "GLS continues to supply top quality cables at a reasonable price.

I suppose you could spend more, and still be happy, but why not spend less if it works as well? Then spend your savings on something else!
