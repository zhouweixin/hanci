[{"review": "I've used a lot of cables and I always come back to HOSA, they are indeed some of the best audio cables in their price range on the market.", "id": 5}, {"review": "Well if this review survives the censors just know that these are great screws when you run out of the original screws you were supplied with your new rack.  They work.", "id": 22}, {"review": "I'm used to the mic extension that uses a short gooseneck.  Occassionally there are problems with this set up.  Then I saw these.  No more bendable problems, I really love these extensions.", "id": 143}, {"review": "I needed a way to boost the input of a wired lapel microphone coming from the preacher directly into my powered speakers.  Works great!", "id": 374}, {"review": "Great laser, nice big fat stars, red and green, worth the money.  Point it at the ceiling or on the wall behind me.  Great effect.", "id": 729}, {"review": "The adjustment screw for the boom is a piece of crap, a really small set screw that strips out almost immediately.  Replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand.  They are light weight and if all you need is mic support in a fixed setting, good enuf okay I guess.  But after transporting and reset, I found them to be junk.", "id": 815}, {"review": "Okay well I lied in subject line, bad singers sound bad whatever mic you put in their hand.  I can say that with authority since I run KJ shows 6 nights a week and have for the last 20+ years, so I know good singers when I hear them.  And they will ask if I have a shure SM58, to which i reply Hell No, you think I'm going to put a 58 in the hands of a careless drunk?  The more you drink the better you sound or so some of my patrons believe.  Some also drop the mic or worse, spike the mic.  I'd rather lose one of these Behringers than a 58.  Or a wireless 58.  Sound wise these are great for their intended purpose.  If you need a sturdy all metal cheap mic, this is the bargain.", "id": 405}]
