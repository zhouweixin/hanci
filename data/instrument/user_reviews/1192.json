[{"review": "Virtually eliminates all outside sound, allowing you to dial in a comfortable volume during rehersal and recording sessions.  Nice, flat response.", "id": 146}, {"review": "After reading some poor reviews for goosenecks of 19&#34; or more, I decided to play it safe with a couple of 13&#34; gooseneck =- this way, if a longer unit is needed, I can just screw 2 together.  This is an excellent piece of hardware, very stiff and sturdy with no droop or sag.  Even when I put 2 together to come over the top of my guitar amp so I could mic it from the front, using an SM 57, and this gooseneck holds the mic absolutely still.Great buy.", "id": 176}, {"review": "Great price on a high-quality polishing cloth.Not much else to say about it - it polishes my guitar very nicely.", "id": 219}, {"review": "Ok, so I had to buy another item because 2 items in my cart were \"add-on\" items.  I needed another microphone and I had been toying with the idea of purchasing a GLS mic.  I'm extremely happy I took the chance, and as soon as I submit this review, I'm purchasing another.  This is the best price/value purchase I've made in a long time.  I'm not going to insult your intelligence and say it's the same as the other well-known mic that looks the same, but for my ears and everybody else who's listened to this mic, it sounds clear and clean and is a little hotter than my SM 58.  I just used it to play a show on Friday the 24th, and it performed wonderfully.  The sound guy thought it was an SM 58.  I will definitely buy a couple of the ES-57s as well to mic up some amps.  Now, things may change in a year if the mic doesn't hold up, but it is hefty and solid, and seems to be built like a tank.  Now, if I was dripping money, maybe I would stick with the \"industry standard,\" but when you can buy these at a 3:1 dollar ratio, why on Earth should I?2/6/2014 update: I must say that in some venues, you'll really have to tweak the EQ in order to stop feedback.  So while they are a great value, they feedback in some situations where my Sennheisers do not (but they were 4 times the price. . .).", "id": 425}, {"review": "Ok, 6 TRS patch cables, 6' long each for $30.00? I was skeptical when I purchased these, but I'm happy that I did and will soon be ordering at least 6 more.  Absolutely no noise from my mixer to my stand-alone recorder or to my computer-based interface.Excellent value.Update:  I just received another set of these cables.  I'm extremely happy with the build quality and performance.  I'll be looking at additional items from this company.", "id": 440}, {"review": "Ok, I'm surprised that this unit is now over $15.00.  I only spent $8.59 for this and I'm mad at myself.  It was cheap enough that I rolled the dice to see if I could get away with a decent product for CHEAP.  It feels solid, looks like a real direct box...but sounds like ass.  I couldn't believe that Pyle would put that much effort into a great \"fit and finish\" product, yet not put decent components inside.  This is the noisiest piece of crap I've ever used - I ended up buying another direct box (spent over $60.00).  Pyle has once again lived up to it's name, but they should finish the name properly and re-brand as \"Pyle of S***.\"Sorry folks, but I'd skip this one.  The 5-star ratings must be from employees.  The only reason I didnt' give it one star was because it was so cheap (Remember, I only spent $8.59), and I'm the one that pulled the trigger on the purchase.Live and learn.  Why would I think plugging a $2000.00 guitar into a cheap piece of crap was a good idea?  My fault.", "id": 606}, {"review": "I was looking for a cheap way to get some drums miced up in a hurry for this Saturday's St. Patrick's Day parade.  I took a chance on this kit, even though I have never purchased anything that says \"Pyle\" on the label.  Upon receiving this kit, my first surprise was the quality of the case, and then upon opening, I was surpised to find that these were the EXACT same microphones as the ones I borrowed once from a friend to do some recordings, but branded differently.  He paid about 350-400 for his kit (still cheap by today's standards).I pulled out 1 overhead condensor and the kick-drum mic and mounted them, fired up the PA and had our drummer play a bit and was shocked at the clarity of the overhead mic!  We could probably get away with just using this one microphone to mic the entire kit, or two overheads; they pick up everything very clearly.  I turned up the volume on the kick-drum mic and was even more surprised to hear the thump of a much more expensive mic coming out of this seemingly too-small mic.  Now, I have a wonderful drum mix coming from only 2 microphones and my mixer has more channels free than I would have expected.  For fun, I added one of the tom/snare mics and they sounded equally clear.After purchasing this, I can tell you that there is absolutely NO way I would purchase one of the \"high-end\" drum-mic kits.  If you are looking for a solution for recording or live sound, this is it.  I promise you will LOVE the sound and you will be ecstatic about the price you paid to get that sound.", "id": 689}]
