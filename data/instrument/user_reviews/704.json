[{"review": "I used it to hold down the strings on my bass while I adjusted the truss rod. Worked perfectly for that purpose.", "id": 116}, {"review": "I like the strings. I'll be changing them soon though, because they have a really light sound and I like the smooth low sound. I like that these strings come with a code that allows you to determine whether they are authentic or counterfeit. Will buy these again.", "id": 197}, {"review": "I love this cable. I don't get any buzz when I hook up my bass and it can handle anything I throw at it. The sound quality is amazing.", "id": 493}, {"review": "The cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes. I don\"t like how the tips screw on and off and the fabric shielding slid out of place the first time I used it. The cable worked well for about two weeks but then it lost current in the middle of a session and I lost sound. This cable is complete garbage. Never again!", "id": 735}, {"review": "Almost dropped my bass on the floor a couple days before i got these bad boys. When I put them on I felt confident that I wouldn't have that issue anymore. It's easier to strap up because of the quick release tab. This should be every bassist/guitarist's best friend.", "id": 44}]
