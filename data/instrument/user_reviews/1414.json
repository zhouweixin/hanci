[{"review": "This strap is not only nice looking and an excellent product.  Well made and sturdy. It would be hard to beat.", "id": 189}, {"review": "This is a very nice product to use.  I would recommend it to anyone. It is small enough to be out of the way while playing.", "id": 304}, {"review": "Great sound over the original strings.  I did find these strings a little difficult to install because of the size.  They will draw blood if your not careful so watch it while replacing the small strings.  The G and the D were fine.", "id": 408}, {"review": "These picks are nice but just  too small. My only regret is that I had taken more time to research the size.  They work well just need to be a little bigger.", "id": 686}, {"review": "This unit is very small and tucks away nicely.  It is easy to use.  I do wish they would make the bracket a little stronger but it works well.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Very Nice!!", "id": 785}, {"review": "I like the feel and the rubber on the pick helps to keep it from slipping in your hand while playing.", "id": 503}]
