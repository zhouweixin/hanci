[{"review": "This product is something every guitar owner needs.  It is well built, performs well and sells at a very reasonable price.  The sting cutter works well.", "id": 94}, {"review": "Does what it is designed to do, it holds about 6 picks.  Small piece of adhesive tape on the back. The supplier refunded some of the postage.  Amazon promised to credit my account $10 (credit never appeared) for the highly inflated shipping costs.  A $2 item cost $17.70 for shipping!  Be careful and read everything before you click to submit the order.", "id": 167}, {"review": "Simple nylon guitar strap with pick pocket and leather tabs at each end.  Appropiately priced.  Good value.  Not fancy, but who needs a fancy strap for a $90 guitar?  Arrived before projected delivery date. The leather ends are VERY stiff and VERY difficult to use.  Takes a good deal of effort to get them on and off the guitar.", "id": 285}, {"review": "Just what I needed!  The display is easy to read and easier to use.  My old monochrome digical tuner had a needle that would jump around making tuning difficult.  The many colors of the Snark makes tuning quick and easy.  A definate must for any guitar player.", "id": 706}, {"review": "Just what I needed to position my guitar while seated.  I was worried it would not hold the weight, but it does well.", "id": 321}]
