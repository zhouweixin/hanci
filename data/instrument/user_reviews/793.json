[{"review": "It's comfortable. It's adjustable. The color was a good match for the guitar. Unless you regularly gig for hours at a time, why spend 50+ smackers on a strap when this one does just fine? Put the dough into the guitar, not the strap. By several colors for whatever look you are going for at the time.", "id": 74}, {"review": "The perfect wall mount for an acoustic guitar. My daughter loves it. Instrument looks great on her wall, and it is easier than taking out of a case to practice. Installs in 5 minutes with included drywall anchors and screws (or mount to wall studs).", "id": 166}, {"review": "If you have an acoustic/electric uke, this is an ideal companion if you take the uke to friends, beach, road trip, camping, etc. It's quite small, and easy to pack into a backpack or bag. It's not a great electric amp, but it does a surprisingly good job amplifying a uke. Use a 9-volt when you need it, or buy a 9v AC adapter to plug into an outlet. You can't find a better option on a budget, when fun and convenience is more important than audiophile-quality sound.", "id": 605}, {"review": "The perfect wall mount for a ukulele.

Strings make a big difference in any ukulele.", "id": 830}, {"review": "My son uses this for practicing at home with his electric bass (Jazz Band) and his standup bass (Chamber Orchestra). It is solid, yet flexible in height and angle. Assembly was a breeze. This is the classic music stand in schools and is also excellent for home use. Built like a tank. Should last forever and can be passed down to the next generation of musicians in the family.", "id": 158}]
