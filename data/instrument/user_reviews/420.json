[{"review": "Mics are like pants, you have to find the right fit. This one I like for my vocals live. I sing fairly low and airy - works great for me. Also used to mic resonator guitar through a tube mic preamp live, very sweet sound. I prefer it to the 58, seems a bit more bright and natural. Might purchase another one eventually...", "id": 23}, {"review": "I play resonator guitars open tuned. These are the only strings that hold up well to the tension of an open &#34;A&#34; tuning. I recently tried multiple other brands and gauges (almost every B string snapped / to C#) only to come back to these... Only wish they came in packs of 10 cause I go through about three sets a month (3 guitars)", "id": 198}, {"review": "Most comfortable picks - only complaint is that I would like four in a pack. If you use all four fingers buy two sets...", "id": 404}, {"review": "Good quality. Adjustable and does not get in the way, Great improvement over spring capos. Not much more to say but need five more words to post", "id": 761}, {"review": "Sat on my Snark - Good tuner but takes some patience. No quick tuning, but great for exact tuning if you are recording etc. Would probably buy again, however will also get another Snark - much easier for quick stage / sight tuning", "id": 711}]
