[{"review": "This are some great strings. I have bought them my last 3 times and I will continue to buy them. I like that they are a little thicker then the ones that came on my guitar. The tone is much bettter too.", "id": 226}, {"review": "I have tried other picks like this that had points which wen't as confortable. This one is more confortable and has great grip. If you drop your picks a lot then this is a great pick to try out.", "id": 680}, {"review": "Easy to use and makes changing out strings easy. The winder is great, but the cutter and pin pull is also part of it making it the only tool needed for changing out strings. The construction is pretty high quality with a mix of metal and plastic parts.", "id": 94}, {"review": "This pedal works great and doesn't slide at all. The adjustment helps me to get just the right amount of distortion I need. Not the best pedal out there by far, but great for a beginner with a limited budget.", "id": 280}, {"review": "I have about 4 different types of tuners and this is the best of them all. I have small kids and birds around the house so many tuners get lost with the noise. This one works off the vibration of the guitar so it is right every time even with a lot of noise around.", "id": 706}]
