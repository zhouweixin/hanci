[{"review": "Works great especially for the price. Just put a little more highs and mids when you eq it, and its pretty close to the sm58.", "id": 213}, {"review": "I got this for $150 dollars when it was on sale. I don't like 8 inch speakers for gigging, but it has unbelievably good sound when going from the line out into a PA. The 8 inch speaker is okay for practice, and it has a jack for an external cabinet. Be careful with the load you put on your amp though.", "id": 553}, {"review": "It is built like a tank, but it quit working after a couple of weeks. I haven't made time trouble shoot it yet, so I'm not sure what component has failed.", "id": 758}, {"review": "It could use a little more on the sustain side like my mxr, but it does what it is supposed to.", "id": 834}, {"review": "I did not think a pedal under 40 bucks could sound this good. It does. You have to try it to believe it. I don't like the demonic face on the front though, so I knocked off a star. Otherwise it would be an easy 5 stars.", "id": 795}]
