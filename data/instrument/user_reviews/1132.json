[{"review": "it's ok but a little cheaper quality than I expected.  I would recommend going a little higher price.  It also arrived cracked.", "id": 78}, {"review": "cheap, easy to use, cuts sound 70%.  Ideal for the beginner or those living in an apartment.  Works exactly as described.  If you want 90% sound reduction however you will need a metal mute.  This one works better than the smaller rubber ones.", "id": 211}, {"review": "I prefer Shar's Overture premieres which are the same price.  These ones are a little too &#34;bright&#34; in sound and not deep or resonant enough.  Also bear in mind these are not dominants which are clearly far superior - but for which you would be paying $50 a set.", "id": 242}, {"review": "This does work as described.  It arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out.  The reason I only gave it two stars however is because I find it so uncomfortable!  Its quite hard on your collarbone.  I have added foam to it and now it works well, but I suspect one might be better just buying a foam one in the first place.", "id": 637}, {"review": "Basically very good.  The buttons are fairly intuitive but some basic functions are incongrously hidden beneath multiple layers of menus.  The sound recorded, while crystal clear is a little on the quiet side even after adjustment of the record and play back features.", "id": 750}, {"review": "Easy to use, portable, cheap.  Not exact in tuning, might want a more expensive one if you are a professional musican.  For most of us this is more than adequate.", "id": 707}]
