[{"review": "Super easy to install on guitar, they look great and they make changing strings a breeze. In just a few minutes I had restrung and tuned my guitar with no problems at all. The best replacement for Fender tuners, by far.", "id": 387}, {"review": "This is a simple footswitch that allows you to switch between two different presets on your Fender Mustang amp. It is very easy to use, and works exactly as advertised. This switch is not bulletproof, but works great for playing around with your small practice amp.", "id": 563}, {"review": "I use these cables in my home, hooked up from my audio interface to my monitors. They appear to be very well built and sound just fine. I have had them for several months and they are working perfectly. Highly recommended for the price.", "id": 591}, {"review": "This amp is a ton of fun. The presets sound great by themselves, but you can also spend hours tweaking the sounds with the Fender Fuse software. It is a fun little amp for both pros and beginners alike.", "id": 718}, {"review": "This pedal is amazing. It is a very good sounding distortion pedal, seems to be very sturdy and the price is absolutely unbeatable. For $30 there is no reason not to try it. You won't be disappointed if you do!", "id": 794}]
