[{"review": "I am yet another one of those \"Forever Beginners\" when it comes to playing the guitar. Never mind that...these guitar strings made second hand guitar sound so much better! After putting in new pegs and re-stringing with these strings...it sounds so much nicer! More richer! Now I see I need to replace the saddle and bridge on it as the pegs keep coming loose. I think that once I do this and then re-string these same strings on it...I will be set to go!I like that these strings are light as due to not having had much practice for a number of years...let's face it...my fingers get sore when playing! I also have small fingers and hands.I intend to continue purchasing these same strings for future use.I recommend!", "id": 28}, {"review": "But these seemed to work well on the guitar I was re-stringing. My son thought they were great and he knows quite a bit more.Recommend.", "id": 59}, {"review": "Nothing that spectacular really! It did it's job. Was easy for my husband to use. Made me able to use a strap on my guitar.", "id": 478}, {"review": "Had one of these before but had given it away when I gave my old guitar away...wanted one again so found this one and bought it. Works well!", "id": 625}, {"review": "As I am one of those \"forever beginners\" when it comes to playing a guitar I may not be able to tell you all that this capo does. The reason I ordered it is to hold my strings so I can set my guitar. I may play around with it to see what all it does.Good price, just as described!", "id": 603}]
