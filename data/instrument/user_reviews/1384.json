[{"review": "For the price, this works really well. I see no faults. It can unscrew pretty easily, but this is hardly a problem right now.", "id": 6}, {"review": "It has been a while since I put new strings on my acoustic guitar. These went on with no problems. They have a brassy sound to them. Since purchasing them, they still ring nicely.", "id": 198}, {"review": "This was my first strap. It looks good, feels pretty strong, and it is difficult to strap to the guitar. By being difficult, I mean it takes some time to squeeze it to the buttons, and it holds on tight. This makes me feel safe having my guitar suspended about three to four feet above the ground. You can't beat the price either!", "id": 282}, {"review": "This bag is well padded, has backpack straps to carry comfortable, and several pockets to hold cable, extra strings, picks, and much, much more. For the price, I feel like it is a steal. Some people complain about the smell. It kind of smells like motor oil. It is strange, but being I have been around that smell so much, it doesn't bother me. Be warned about it though.", "id": 311}, {"review": "I recently bought this for my first electric guitar and I thoroughly enjoy it. It has a lot of power and noise behind it. It is a little starter amp, just in case the picture was a little deceiving. I cranked it up quite loud and it produces clean sound without terrible distortion. With distortion, it sounds great. It is a solid piece of work, and it makes a great practice amp and possibly a great starter amp.", "id": 564}]
