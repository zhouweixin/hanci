[{"review": "This is my second Ernie Ball strap i have gotten, and sure there are cheaper straps out there its a crapshoot what your going to get from them. These straps have leather ends that hold the guitar securely, the strap itself is a step down from a seatbelt (If a seatbelt will keep me in place at high speeds this strap will keep your guitar in place at low speeds), and the length would be sufficient even if you are 7 ft. tall. Coming in several different colors to match any color guitar this is the only strap i will buy in the future.", "id": 74}, {"review": "Don't let the price and the fact that they are plastic fool you. This is an awesome pedal. Ive had it for a couple of months now and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a metal sound. It is made of a tough plastic and as long as you don't abuse it to much it should be fine. You can adjust all range of sound and make it yours. As the title states I love the sound and I also love the price. Buy this!", "id": 434}, {"review": "I keep all my guitars in my room and I had to many stands cluttering it up. The screws they sent with were plenty long enough and all three that I got are holding guitars to the wall, on drywall nonetheless. So given that if you have a wood wall you should have no problem. They all are sturdy enough, and i have always been suspect of wall hangers. best deal and does the job.", "id": 779}, {"review": "Does what it says. I have multiple pedals plugged to it and it can handle them. Much cheaper then buying loads of 9v batteries.", "id": 428}, {"review": "I love these strings. I get a much higher output , much better response and much better sound. Great strings for just a little more.", "id": 825}]
