[{"review": "Very nice product. Strings feel and sound noticeably better plus the white mineral oil smells really good when applied to the neck.", "id": 72}, {"review": "cable is conducive of good tone but jacks wear out after about one year of use. Still highly recommended for the money,", "id": 168}, {"review": "use the cloth often to polish my guitar. The fender logo makes it look legit.  Recommended to one and all.", "id": 219}, {"review": "Make sure you order the right size! I don't use this product very often but it provides great sustained and does not kill strings.", "id": 340}, {"review": "provides a great finish with a nice glossy shine.  Does not leave streaks if used properly.  This dries quickly every time.", "id": 351}, {"review": "Strings rust very easily, yield fairly poor tone and break often, though they have the same bending ability as .09-.42.", "id": 396}, {"review": "Very good product.  Bought it about two years ago along with a fender mustang 1.  It comes with a Daisy Chain power cord that eliminates the need for separate power supplies. Foam inserts easily fit Boss and Behringer pedals but can be easily cut to house other pedals.", "id": 462}, {"review": "Capo serves me well and the spring mechanism has held up for a year now and does not show signs of deterioration.", "id": 603}, {"review": "good tone but dicey controls. Like the features especially the noise gate but do not use the scoop very much.", "id": 638}, {"review": "Bought this amp probably about two years ago. The amp has 3 levels of 8 presets each, for a total of 24 unique presets, ranging form heavy metal distortion sounds and reverberating clean tones. (The '65 Twin Reverb on the Orange Level is by far my favorite.) The amp includes gain, a volume and separate master volume knob in addition to bass and treble knobs. I feel like it is a bargain at any price. A great amp for practice and beginners.", "id": 718}]
