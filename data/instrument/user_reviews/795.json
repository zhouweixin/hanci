[{"review": "I got it to have it if I needed it. I have found that i don't really need it that often and rarely use it. If I was really good I can see the need. But this is a keyboard not an organ.", "id": 2}, {"review": "Makes stringing so much easier with the peg puller, and cutter all in one. Arrived quick and before scheduled. These work perfect for my needs", "id": 94}, {"review": "I like that I can disconnect my strap quickly and easily. Makes playing more comfortable and if you have more than one guitar you can use the same favorite strap quickly. I buy one of these for each guitar. But I only use my favorite strap.", "id": 174}, {"review": "A must have for the Yamaha PA130. You can plug ti in instead of using 100 batteries. That keeps the weight down tremendously and as long as yo have a plug youa re good to go.", "id": 476}, {"review": "I hate string noise and a dirty acoustic. This kit covers all the bases from the fret board to the body. My favorite acoustic guitar is over 40 years old and it looks like a brand new guitar and no annoying string noise when I am changing chords or fingering the fret-board.", "id": 95}, {"review": "I prefer the light strings but you have to allow them to stretch a little or you might break on when changing. The lighter the less tension you should use. I love the price and they last me quite a while.", "id": 198}, {"review": "This works perfect with the quick release system I also purchased. I mostly purchased this so my buddies can play my guitars without adjusting my favorite strap. It also has a pick holder that comes in handy when you need an spare, or want to put it away without loosing it.", "id": 285}]
