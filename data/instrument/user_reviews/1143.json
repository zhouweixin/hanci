[{"review": "I purchased this case for my newLine 6 POD HD 500. It's a well built, solid case for the price. It fits the HD 500 very snugly and has large pocket on the front for cables. I wouldn't drop my POD in this thing, but as a basic light duty carrying case it does the job very well.", "id": 165}, {"review": "These screws are not a shiny chrome, so they worked perfectly for my pearl pickguard and black Fender Strat body. They are good quality screws.", "id": 215}, {"review": "I purchased a 12 for the price of 10 pack of these from Musician's Friend. I've used Elixirs for years and decided to try regular strings again. This 12 pack was about the same price as 2-3 packs of Elixirs. So far I am very happy with these strings. They sound and feel great.", "id": 226}, {"review": "I was doing research on a new guitar rig and I kept seeing this amp mentioned. Almost all of the reviews I read were positive. I decided to order it for a home practice amp when I don't want to dig out my main rig.The build quality is solid - it feels like a much more expensive amp. Many amps in this price range seem cheap and poorly constructed. I was really impressed with the packaging, the documentation and the build of the amp. This is my first Fender amp and probably not my last.The sound quality is amazing. Being a heavier rock/metal player, I would never have chosen a Fender amp even for home practice. The first channel has a wonderful clean tone and the second channel has several modeled amps. The tone ranges from clean to jazz to high gain. There is even an acoustic model, and it sounds pretty good too. There are a ton of Youtube videos of people demoing the sounds of this amp so I won't go much further into this.The included effects are simple but pretty cool as well, and can be switched on and off via the optional foot switch.Overall I'd say that this is a great amp for the price, and like many others, I highly recommend it.", "id": 561}, {"review": "This is a highly feature-full amp at this price point. I can get great clean, blues and heavy metal tones. Like most Line 6 products, some features are not highly apparent. For example, for extra gain, you can hold down the tuner button and turn the gain knob past 12 o'clock for a boost. This may not sound like much, but it really CAN change the tone, even on clean channels. On the crunch channel, for example, it gives the guitar an almost fuzz face overdriven sound (with my Strat). On the metal channels, it really drives the gain over the top.The tuner seems to work well enough and the included effects are OK. I decided to go with the cheaper FBV2 pedal (which is still over 1/3 the price of this amp!) and it really works well for home practice situations. One can switch between clean and metal, or clean and blues without too much trouble (one click). I think the pedals are too expensive personally, but they are well constructed solid steel and seem very durable. The cable is a simple cat 5 network cable I believe, so replacing should be trivial.I live in an apartment and this little 15-watt amp is WAY too loud to turn up past 1 or 2. It has a great tone balance (to my ears). It has corner protectors where even their flagship amp doesn't! Overall I recommend this amp to anyone looking for a cheaper home practice amp.", "id": 619}, {"review": "I've had several PODs and have never really been impressed with their tone. Right out of the box, the HD 500 totally blew me away. I know their marketing calls it \"HD\" because of the added tonal characteristics, and it's true - there is a huge difference between the HD series and the older PODs. I can't really say why they sound better, but to my ears the amp models sound significantly better than the older PODs without much tweaking and NO EQing (although one can tweak the tone with several EQs).One complaint with the older PODs (that I agree with) was that one could never seem to get a great high gain tone. This is not the case with the HD 500. I've been able to get some great high gain tones out of it without much work.At first, I purchased theLine 6 POD HD 300because I didn't see the value of the HD 500. After thinking about it, I decided to pick up the HD 500 and compare the two pedals. I definitely think the HD 500 is worth the extra cash, even for a hobbyist such as myself. There are extra controls on the looper, and extra record time. The wah pedal seems to be better constructed on the 500s (I could be wrong, but I DO remember them being different). The dual tone feature and flexible routing options of the HD 500 are amazing. I'm sure I'm forgetting some differences, but I know I'm happy that I went with the HD 500 over the HD 300.The drivers seem to work great on both Windows 7 Pro 64-bit and Mac OS 10.6 (they have 64-bit Mac drivers now). The included software is OK - I get the feeling they are still building it out. It's a bit glitchy but seems to work OK for the most part. The software updater works great and I've already had a couple of firmware updates since I purchased the HD 500 (bug fixes). There is also a much anticipated firmware upgrade coming at the end of this month that will add six more amp models and several adjustable parameters that are supposed to really help dial in the correct \"tube amp feel and behavior\".I nearly purchased the M13 to plug into myFender Super Champ XD Electric Guitar Amplifier, but I noticed the HD 500 had the same number of effects PLUS amp modelling for the same price! I know the two pedals are designed for different purposes, but for me the HD 500 made much more sense. I can use it to practice with headphones, or plug into my amp as an effects pedal. To use it as an effects only pedal, one need only disable the amp modeling and set the output mode to match the appropriate amp setup. I also decided to test playing the HD 500 directly into aBehringer Eurolive B215D Active 550-Watt 2-Way PA Speaker System with 15-inch Woofer and 1.35-inch Compression Driver, which may replace my other amps as my primary rig (I get the Behringer today, so we'll see).The build quality over the POD X3 Live has improved. The case is now entirely metal vs. a combination of metal and plastic. I can definitely see this being heavy road/gig worthy. I also purchased aGator GK2110 Compact Keyboard Gig Bag, which fits the HD 500 (albeit very snugly).Overall I'm very happy with this setup, and recommend this amp modeler/effects pedal to anyone looking to practice at home (especially with headphones) on a wide variety of musical styles.", "id": 700}, {"review": "I purchased these for a Fender Squier Affinity Strat. Be aware that they will NOT fit a Squier without drilling some holes. The stock tuners have one peg - these have two. Despite this, installing them was quite easy. They have a high build quality and work great. I was hesitant to buy locking tuners at first, but now I'm glad I did.", "id": 387}]
