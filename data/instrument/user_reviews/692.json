[{"review": "These came stock on my Jackson Kelly KEXMG. All the other guitars I own have Schaller buttons on them and I have one main strap I use for all of the guitars. I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out. Not twenty min later I was removing them and putting Schaller buttons in their place. Here the 3 major reasons I did not like them over Schaller:1- Bulky. They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!2- Problems engaging. I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. It wasn't until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.3- Cheap. They just feel cheap. Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.For a few bucks more I'll stick with Schaller's. I have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail.", "id": 44}, {"review": "This is my fifth time buying this stuff! I really like the new container. The tin is way nicer than the old plastic one. This stuff works great and lasts forever! I play daily and one stick will last me at least a year before it gets too dirty/dry to use. One swipe is plenty (2 strings at a time from nut to bridge); then just fold the cloth and wipe clean. Makes moving power chords and soloing so much easier.", "id": 72}, {"review": "Unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage! I tune my hellraiser to d then drop to c and it will not register. the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes.", "id": 624}, {"review": "As other reviewers have noted, the ends are too short and dont allow the cable to \"click\" into the jack of your guitar or amp. Easily remedied by cutting back the rubber by about 1/8\" then the cable is fine.Other than that I like the cable construction and the large sized ends.", "id": 195}, {"review": "Installed these on my Schecter C-1 Hellraiser. I had very high hopes for these, but as with any new over-hyped technology, they failed to impress me. The only good thing I have to say is the tone is good. But realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings. You would barely be able to hear the difference in a side by side comparison. So now that I have wasted almost double the price on these it gets worse. They are not silky smooth feeling as advertised. If anything they feel worse than regular strings. Last but not least: they are bad for frets. Just like stainless strings; harder metal against nickel frets is going to wear them out real quick. I don't know about anyone else but I don't want to have my guitar re-fretted every 2 years.For the very miniscule difference in tone they are not worth the extra money or equipment wear and tear.", "id": 825}]
