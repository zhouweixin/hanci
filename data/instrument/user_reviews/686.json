[{"review": "I've been using the same Straploks on all my guitars for the past 10+ years.  I have not had one fail on me ever.  Just be sure to tug on it after you put your strap on to make sure it's on right.  I've struggled with the C clip in the past, but what are you going to do?  It's a one time thing when you first install, so it's no biggie.", "id": 44}, {"review": "I've been using these picks for 10+ years, they've always been great.  Between these blues and the yellow, I'm covered.", "id": 61}, {"review": "I've had a few of these my life time because people always steal capos.  What the hell.  Anyway, this capo works well.  I've only used it on Gibson and Fender electrics, and it does a fine job.  Some of the rubber padding will eventually come off as glue wears off, but it does not affect the capo-abilities.  I'm sure there are better ones, but for me, this works well.", "id": 116}, {"review": "I'm pretty impressed with it.  I've only used plug-in types of tuners prior, and this was a nice surprise.  I ran this through my ukulele, electric guitars as well as an electric bass.  I was blown away how it could tune my bass.  It works quickly, and it seems pretty accurate compared to my Petersen.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Took one star off for visibility.  Certain lighting and certain angles can wash out the display very easily.", "id": 762}, {"review": "Been using these for years.  I like the Regular Slinkies, too, but it seems these tend to last longer.  Or, it could just be in my head.  Either way, I am happy with them.", "id": 156}, {"review": "Between the blue and the yellow, I have my needs covered.  These have a weird feeling when you first get them, like they have powder on them.  But within 10 minutes of using it, it'll stick with you much better.  I love these picks.", "id": 455}]
