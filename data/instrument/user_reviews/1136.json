If you appreciate the talent of David Gilmour, and respect his taste and choices in music, than I would recommend these strings.

I have played guitar for over 30 years, and I am very happy with these strings.", "id": 499}, {"review": "I bought many professional mic stands through the years, before this item, and I can not tell the difference. Well built, made to last, and looks great. I highly recommend this item.", "id": 585}, {"review": "I gave it two stars because the expression pedal stopped working after the second day , and visually it's hard to read because the lettering is so small.
