Excellent product.", "id": 762}, {"review": "Does what it's supposed to do.  Very sturdy feeling.  Pretty sure I could strangle a person with it if I had to.  I'm not a dangerous person but you know, when people request wagon-wheel.......", "id": 803}, {"review": "Unbelievable clear sounding on a Mandolin.  Can't yet get the sound out of a violin that I want with it but still experimenting.  Will have to find a way to keep the cord secure while it's connected as the slightest movement or adjustment makes a lot of noise.All in all 7$ very well spent.  Thank goodness pickup prices are coming down.  Only a few years ago you could not find a pickup-mic even this good for &#60;100$.  Now if only the price of pickup-chics would come down. :(", "id": 848}, {"review": "Works perfectly.  Got the drivers for Mac from the website and it instantly showed up in core-audio. Very easy to use. Love it!", "id": 874}, {"review": "Takes the edge off the violin sound. I keep it on my office violin so I don't disturb my neighbors which is silly because they are honduran spanish instructors and they sing shakira at ridiculous volume constantly.....", "id": 211}]
