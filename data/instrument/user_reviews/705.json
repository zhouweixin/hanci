[{"review": "Use these to replace the garbage machines that came on my (older model) Gold Tone banjo ukulele. Smooth as silk, work great - as all GROVERS do!", "id": 275}, {"review": "Now, this is one GREAT piece of kit. Two chanels, 60 watts RMS (real power), and super control over the sound of each channel. Only complaint? IT'S BUH-TUGLY! Sickly brown... cheesy looking. If she was my prom date, I'd put a sack over her head (yeah, well, not that I'm another George Clooney or anything).", "id": 703}, {"review": "The Snark is great. I have 2 for my 4 ukuleles (so I can always find one),and a 3rd for my guitar. It's not just a UKE tuner. LOVE THEM! And, gavemy grandson a shock-blue one to go with his American Flag painted uke.", "id": 763}, {"review": "... but... they're the cheesiest looking leather I've ever seen... real leather for sure, but somehow the maker found real leather that looks like cheap vinyl imitation leather.", "id": 877}, {"review": "I really wanted to like these, but they're a frickin, lint-catching sticky frickin' mess! They went from my wife's snare back into the holder in a New York Minute, have never seen the light of day, and may have been thrown in the garbage. Save your money. We use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now.", "id": 892}]
