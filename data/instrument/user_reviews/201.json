[{"review": "Sounds like my original.  Enough said.  Great pedal and it is still built like a tank.  I do appreciate that on this version, one can use a pretty standard AC adapter. A+.", "id": 41}, {"review": "I put these on a dual humbucker USA Strat.  The neck was pre-drilled so the posts on the tuners and the diameter of the center post fit perfectly.  Job only took about 15 minutes.  Excellent build and looks great.", "id": 387}, {"review": "I needed a footswitch for a variety of applications to include an acoustic amp, guitar amps, and other guitar/audio gear.  Built like a tank and completely configurable.  Well done again, Roland!", "id": 412}, {"review": "I have a very nice pedal board for my guitar rig, but not enough power for 13 pedals.  This totally solved the problem with no noise or power issues.  Very smart idea and well thought out for anyone needing a one stop solution for DC distribution.  A+!", "id": 428}, {"review": "If you love delay and want variety, this is your pedal.  I run two amps when I play (often) and the ping pong is delightful for me.  However, in the studio, this pedal shines as well providing a variety of incredible delay options.  Being Toneprint enabled is a 100% plus.  Very clean, quiet, and durable.  Excellence!", "id": 742}, {"review": "The best non-rackmount reverb I have ever had.  So many options, clean, transparent, and whisper quiet.  This is the last pedal at the end of my pedal board chain.  The Toneprint option is great as well to create and personalize your own verb.  Excellence once again from TC.", "id": 748}, {"review": "TC just does things right.  I love how easy this is to use, the incredible clarity of sound, and 5 minutes of recording time.  I do a single, duo, and full band.  It goes with me to all gigs and I do use it for when I am practicing.  Highly recommended solution.", "id": 869}]
